<li><a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Commandments</a></li>
<li>Penalties/Consequence: Many commands lack specific penalties in Deuteronomy, with consequences often tied to the general curses of Deut. 28:15-68 or specific punishments like death (e.g., for idolatry, adultery, murder) or curses (Deut. 27). Some penalties are drawn from related Torah passages (e.g., Exodus, Leviticus).
<ul>
<li>Deuteronomy 28:15-68 (<a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Deut-28#v15</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Ransom</a>: Atonement is rarely specified in Deuteronomy, except for cases like the heifer ritual (Deut. 21:1-9) or purification processes (e.g., Deut. 23:11, Lev. 14:1-32 for leprosy). Most violations lack explicit atonement instructions in Deuteronomy, often implying repentance or adherence to general sacrificial laws in Leviticus.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Hebrews 10:26</strong> <strong>For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins</strong>, 27 but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries. 28 A man who disregards Moses’ law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 29 <strong>How much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God</strong>, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know him who said, “Vengeance belongs to me. I will repay,” says the Lord. Again, “The Lord will judge his people.” 31 <strong>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John 14:15</strong>: &quot;If you love me, you will keep my commandments (mitzvah).&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John 14:21</strong>: &quot;Whoever has my commandments (mitzvah) and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John 15:10</strong>: &quot;If you keep my commandments (mitzvah), you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments (mitzvah) and abide in his love.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1 John 5:2-3</strong>: &quot;By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments (entolē). For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments (mitzvah). And his commandments (entolē) are not burdensome.&quot;</p>

Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is committed in Israel, then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Penalty or Consequence</strong>: Death by stoning (Deut. 17:5).</li>
<li><strong>Offering or Ransom</strong>: None specified in Deuteronomy. Leviticus 4:27-31 mentions sin offerings for unintentional sins, but idolatry is a deliberate &quot;high-handed&quot; sin, typically unforgivable without repentance (Num. 15:30-31). <a class="internal-link" target="" data-note-icon="undefined" href="/gate-of-wisdom/offering/sins-requiring-death-no-offering/">Sins Requiring Death - No Offering</a></li>

<li><strong>Scripture text (WEB)</strong>: &quot;But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die. If you say in your heart, 'How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?'—when a prophet speaks in Yahweh’s name, if the thing doesn’t follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Penalty or Consequence</strong>: Death (Deut. 18:20).</li>
<li><strong>Offering or Ransom</strong>: None specified.

<li><strong>Penalty or Consequence</strong>: Death by the avenger of blood (Deut. 19:12).</li>

So you shall put away the evil from among you.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Penalty or Consequence</strong>: The false witness receives the punishment intended for the accused (Deut. 19:19).</li>

You shall come to the priests who are Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days. You shall inquire, and they shall give you the verdict. You shall do according to the verdict which they shall give you from that place which Yahweh chooses. You shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you. According to the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do. You shall not turn away from the sentence which they announce to you, to the right hand, nor to the left. The man who does presumptuously in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die.

<li><strong>Scripture text (WEB)</strong>: &quot;But if the man finds the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die; but to the lady you shall do nothing.
