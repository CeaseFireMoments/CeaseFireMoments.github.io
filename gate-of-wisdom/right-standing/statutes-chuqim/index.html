<li>Penalties/Consequence: Many commands lack specific penalties in Deuteronomy, with consequences often tied to the general curses of Deut. 28:15-68 or specific punishments like death (e.g., for idolatry, adultery, murder) or curses (Deut. 27). Some penalties are drawn from related Torah passages (e.g., Exodus, Leviticus).
<ul>
<li>Deuteronomy 28:15-68 (<a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Deut-28#v15</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Ransom</a>: Atonement is rarely specified in Deuteronomy, except for cases like the heifer ritual (Deut. 21:1-9) or purification processes (e.g., Deut. 23:11, Lev. 14:1-32 for leprosy). Most violations lack explicit atonement instructions in Deuteronomy, often implying repentance or adherence to general sacrificial laws in Leviticus.</li>

<li><strong>Hebrews 10:26</strong> <strong>For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins</strong>, 27 but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries. 28 A man who disregards Moses’ law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 29 <strong>How much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God</strong>, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know him who said, “Vengeance belongs to me. I will repay,” says the Lord. Again, “The Lord will judge his people.” 31 <strong>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God</strong></li>
