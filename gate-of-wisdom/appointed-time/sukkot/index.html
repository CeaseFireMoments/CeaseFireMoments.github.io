<li>Sukkot (סוכות)</li>
<li>Literal Translation: &quot;Booths,&quot; &quot;huts,&quot; or &quot;tabernacles.&quot; It refers to temporary shelters or dwellings.</li>
<li>Sukkot is a major Jewish holiday (one of the three pilgrimage festivals) celebrated in the fall, commemorating the Israelites' 40 years of wandering in the desert after the Exodus from Egypt, during which they lived in temporary booths (sukkot). It also marks the harvest season. Observances include building and dwelling in a sukkah (a booth-like structure) for seven days, as described in the Torah (e.g., Leviticus 23:42-43).</li>

<li>‘On the first day is a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.</li>
<li>‘For seven days you bring an offering made by fire to יהוה. On the eighth day there shall be a set-apart gathering for you, and you shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה. It is a closing festival, you do no servile work.</li>
<li>‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh new moon, when you gather in the fruit of the land, celebrate the festival of יהוה for seven days. On the first day is a rest, and on the eighth day a rest.</li>
<li>‘And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of good trees, branches of palm trees, twigs of leafy trees, and willows of the stream, and shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim for seven days.</li>
<li>‘And you shall celebrate it as a festival to יהוה for seven days in the year – a law forever in your generations. Celebrate it in the seventh new moon.</li>
<li>‘Dwell in booths for seven days; all who are native born in Yisra’ĕl dwell in booths,</li>
<li>so that your generations know that I made the children of Yisra’ĕl dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim (Egypt). I am יהוה your Elohim.’ ”</li>

<ul>
<li>And after this יהושע (Yahoshua/Jesus) was walking in Galil (Galilee), for He did not wish to walk in Yehuḏah (Judea), because the Yehuḏim (Jewish) were seeking to kill Him and the festival of the Yehuḏim was near, the Festival of Sukkot.</li>
<li>And about the middle of the festival יהושע went up into the Set-apart Place, and He was teaching.</li>
<li>And the Yehuḏim were marvelling, saying, “How does this Man know letters, not having learned?” יהושע answered them and said, “My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me</li>
<li>“Did not Mosheh give you the Torah? Yet not one of you does the Torah! Why do you seek to kill Me?”</li>
<li>יהושע therefore cried out in the Set-apart Place, teaching and saying, “You both know Me, and you know where I am from. And I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know. But I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.</li>
<li>And on the last day, the great day of the festival, יהושע stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me, and let him who believes in Me drink.</li>
<li>“As the Scripture said, out of His innermost shall flow rivers of living water.”</li>
<li>And this He said concerning the Spirit, which those believing in Him were about to receive, for the Set-apart Spirit was not yet given, because יהושע was not yet esteemed.</li>

<ul>
<li>And I, Yoḥanan (John), saw the set-apart city, renewed Yerushalayim (Jerusalem), coming down out of the heaven from Elohim, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</li>
<li>And I heard a loud voice from the heaven saying, “See, the Booth of Elohim is with men, and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and Elohim Himself shall be with them and be their Elohim.</li>

<h2 id="zechariah-14-in-new-jerusalem" tabindex="-1">Zechariah 14 (in New Jerusalem)</h2>
<ul>
<li>And it shall be that all who are left from all the nations which came up against Yerushalayim (Jerusalem), shall go up from year to year to bow themselves to the Sovereign, יהוה (Yahweh) of hosts, and to celebrate the Festival of Sukkot.</li>
<li>And it shall be, that if anyone of the clans of the earth does not come up to Yerushalayim to bow himself to the Sovereign, יהוה of hosts, on them there is to be no rain. And if the clan of Mitsrayim (Egypt) does not come up and enter in, then there is no rain. On them is the plague with which יהוה plagues the nations who do not come up to celebrate the Festival of Sukkot. This is the punishment of Mitsrayim (Egypt) and the punishment of all the nations that do not come up to celebrate the Festival of Sukkot</li>

<p>Genesis 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their array.</li>
<li>And in the seventh day Elohim completed His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.</li>
<li>And Elohim blessed the seventh day and set it apart, because on it He rested from all His work which Elohim in creating had made.</li>
</ul>

<p>God Rests on Mt. Sinai</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“there are voices and lightnings, and a heavy cloud on the mountain and the sound of a very strong horn .. and the sound of the horn is going on, and (is) very strong; Moses speaks, and God answers him with a voice. And YHWH comes down and rests on Mt Sinai to the top of the mountain”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I heard as the voice of a great crowd, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, “Halleluyah, for יהוה Ěl Shaddai reigns! “Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him praise, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife prepared herself.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And he said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who have been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!’ ” And he said to me, “These are the true words of Elohim.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I saw a renewed heaven and a renewed earth, for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away, and the sea is no more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I, John, saw the set-apart city, renewed Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from Elohim, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the heaven saying, “See, the Booth of Elohim is with men, and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and Elohim Himself shall be with them and be their Elohim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I saw no Dwelling Place in it, for יהוה Ěl Shaddai is its Dwelling Place, and the Lamb. And the city had no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it, for the esteem of Elohim lightened it, and the Lamb is its lamp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Blessed are those doing His commands, so that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of life, and to enter through the gates into the city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with the set-apart ones. Amĕn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Feast of Tabernacles is fulfilled.</p>

<li>He will once again fill the creation with His presence.</li>
<li>The sun will never sets on that Seventh Day Rest.</li>
