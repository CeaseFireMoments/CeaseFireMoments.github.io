		"content": "A Mother's Thoughts - Day 1\nFour days of travel, 9 months pregnant, I would not recommend to anyone. I guess Caesar Augustus would have no idea what that would be like now would he! Yet, we reached Bethlehem, safe and sound,  just to find everyone else had gotten here before us. If you had seen Joseph's face when I told him I was about to give birth, lol, priceless. He is such a good man, he looked around and didn't know what to do. So many had gotten here before us, there wasn't any room for us in the main area of the guest chambers, but thankfully we were able to find some room, even if it wasn't in the inn. There are many others with us who were either late arrivals, or couldn't afford a normal guest room. We made do quite nicely though, this little area we are in provides a little privacy. One advantage is all the hay provides a nice resting spot. When Joseph looked around, I think his thought was, &quot;Here, in THIS place, the child of God is going to be born?&quot;\nAnd right here he was born. He's asleep over there in the manger. As a carpenter and stone mason, Joseph can be so industrious. He brought it over, threw some hay in it and made a perfect bed for our little bundle of joy. We even had visitors last night. Can't imagine why anyone would want to come here, especially without being forced to by the government. Such a heavily crowded place. But they did, just the same. They were shepherds who were far off in the fields. They said they were visited by an angel and told of our baby's birth. The shepherds were here all night. Joseph is over there talking with them now as I catch a little rest.\nI remember when I was visited by an angel and told I would be the mother of this child. I was troubled, disturbed, and confused. But the angel said the same thing to me as he said to the shepherd's, &quot;Do not be afraid.&quot; A peace came over me, but when he told me the Holy Spirit was going to come upon me and I would become pregnant, I have to admit, I was afraid. Yet, I knew YHWH/God was with me, and I said, &quot;I am the handmaiden of the Lord; let it be done to me according to what you have said.&quot;\nThe angel told me his name, Yehoshua (Iēsous, Jesus). He told me that Yehoshua would &quot;be great (eminent) and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His forefather David and reign over the house of Jacob throughout the ages; and of His reign there will be no end.&quot;\nI just can't even imagine that right now. He is just a baby. He does what all baby's do. Honestly, he doesn't seem any different, not special in any significant way. Oh, he is special to me, because he is my son, but just a normal little baby, wrapped in swaddling clothes, laying in a feeding trough, in the back of the guest quarters, where the poor people and even animals have stayed. It just doesn't seem like the way a child of God would be born. But such are the ways of God.\nThe shepherds told us there was a multitude of angels praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. What does all this mean for my little boy? How can he ever reign with no end yet there be peace on earth? No one ever reigns in peace. And what does good will toward men mean? Oh, I pray I am given what I need to bring this little boy up in such a way that he is prepared for what God has in store for him.\nWell, he is stirring. He has such a peace and joy about him. He only cries when he needs something. I love him so much, I am so thankful God has chosen me to care for him.\nPLEASE NOTE: This is written from a Mother's Perspective - specifically from Mary's. I did a lot of research into what it would have been like, but this is STRICTLY my imagination, there is no guarantee any of this really happened or really were her thoughts. I do use scripture through out. However, it's mostly how I think I might have thought if I were her. Enjoy!",

These are appointed days by God, they are HIS Holy Days. He said to remember them forever, generation to generation.\nThese Holy Days are symbolic and a shadowing of the first and second coming of the Messiah.\n‘Holy convocation’ is the idea of a dress rehearsal.

It occurs from Wednesday, Tishrei 15 through Tuesday, Tishrei 21.\n\nSt. Jerome (PL 25, 1529 &amp; 1536-7) speaking of how the Judaeo-Christians celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles…tells us that they gave the feast a millenarian significance (Bagatti, Bellarmino. Translated by Eugene Hoade. The Church from the Circumcision. Nihil obstat: Marcus Adinolfi. Imprimi potest: Herminius Roncari. Imprimatur: +Albertus Gori, die 26 Junii 1970. Franciscan Printing Press, Jerusalem, p.202).\n\nIn the days of unleavened bread Paul, coming down from Galatia, arrived in Asia, considering the repose among the faithful in Smyrna to be a great refreshment in Christ Jesus after his severe toil, and intending afterwards to depart to Jerusalem. So in Smyrna he went to visit Strataeas, who had been his hearer in Pamphylia, being a son of Eunice the daughter of Lois. These are they of whom he makes mention when writing to Timothy, saying; Of the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice;whence we find that Strataeas was a brother of Timothy. Paul then, entering his house and gathering together the faithful there, speaks to them concerning the Passover and the Pentecost, reminding them of the New Covenant of the offering of bread and the cup; how that they ought most assuredly to celebrate it during the days of unleavened bread, but to hold fast the new mystery of the Passion and Resurrection. For here the Apostle plainly teaches that we ought neither to keep it outside the season of unleavened bread, as the heretics do, especially the Phrygians…but named the days of unleavened bread, the Passover, and the Pentecost, thus ratifying the Gospel (Pionius. Life of Polycarp , Chapter 2. Translated by J. B. Lightfoot, The Apostolic Fathers, vol. 3.2, 1889, pp.488-506).\n\nWhat must one say, when even He that was gentler than all men so appeals and cries out at the feast of Tabernacles? For it is written; And on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any man thirsteth, let him come to Me and drink(Chapter 19).\n\nAnd on the sabbath, when prayer had been made long time on bended knee, he, as was his custom, got up to read; and every eye was fixed upon him. Now the lesson was the Epistles of Paul to Timothy and to Titus, in which he says what manner of man a bishop ought to be. And he was so well fitted for the office that the hearers said one to another that he lacked none of those qualities which Paul requires in one who has the care of a church. When then, after the reading and the instruction of the bishops and the discourses of the presbyters, the deacons were sent to the laity to enquire whom they would have, they said with one accord, ‘Let Polycarp be our pastor and teacher’ (Chapter 22).\n\nAnd on the following sabbath he said; ‘Hear ye my exhortation, beloved children of God…’ (Chapter 24). - A book called The Life of Polycarp\n\nPolycrates (http://www.cogwriter.com/polycrates.htm), who was bishop of Ephesus, wrote the following around 195 A.D.:\n\nWe observe the exact day; neither adding, nor taking away. For in Asia also great lights have fallen asleep, which shall rise again on the day of the Lord’s coming, when he shall come with glory from heaven, and shall seek out all the saints. Among these are Philip, one of the twelve apostles, who fell asleep in Hierapolis; and his two aged virgin daughters, and another daughter, who lived in the Holy Spirit and now rests at Ephesus; and, moreover, John (https://www.cogwriter.com/john.htm), who was both a witness and a teacher, who reclined upon the bosom of the Lord, and, being a priest, wore the sacerdotal plate. He fell asleep at Ephesus. And Polycarp (https://www.cogwriter.com/polycarp.htm) in Smyrna, who was a bishop and martyr; and Thraseas (https://www.cogwriter.com/thraseas.htm), bishop and martyr from Eumenia, who fell asleep in Smyrna. Why need I mention the bishop and martyr Sagaris (https://www.cogwriter.com/sagaris.htm) who fell asleep in Laodicea, or the blessed Papirius (https://www.cogwriter.com/papirius.htm), or Melito (https://www.cogwriter.com/melito.htm), the Eunuch who lived altogether in the Holy Spirit, and who lies in Sardis, awaiting the episcopate from heaven, when he shall rise from the dead ? All these observed the fourteenth day of the passover (https://www.cogwriter.com/passover.htm) according to the Gospel, deviating in no respect, but following the rule of faith. And I also, Polycrates, the least of you all, do according to the tradition of my relatives, some of whom I have closely followed. For seven of my relatives were bishops; and I am the eighth. And my relatives always observed the day when the people put away the leaven. I, therefore, brethren, who have lived sixty-five years in the Lord, and have met with the brethren throughout the world, and have gone through every Holy Scripture, am not affrighted by terrifying words. For those greater than I have said ‘ We ought to obey God rather than man’…I could mention the bishops who were present, whom I summoned at your desire; whose names, should I write them, would constitute a great multitude. And they, beholding my littleness, gave their consent to the letter, knowing that I did not bear my gray hairs in vain, but had always governed my life by the Lord Jesus (Eusebius. Church History. Book V, Chapter 24).",

Yet not one of you does the Torah! Why do you seek to kill Me?”\nיהושע therefore cried out in the Set-apart Place, teaching and saying, “You both know Me, and you know where I am from.

And YHWH comes down and rests on Mt Sinai to the top of the mountain”\n\nAnd I heard as the voice of a great crowd, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, “Halleluyah, for יהוה Ěl Shaddai reigns! “Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him praise, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife prepared herself.”\n\nAnd he said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who have been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!’ ” And he said to me, “These are the true words of Elohim.”\n\nAnd I saw a renewed heaven and a renewed earth, for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away, and the sea is no more.\n\nAnd I, John, saw the set-apart city, renewed Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from Elohim, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the heaven saying, “See, the Booth of Elohim is with men, and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and Elohim Himself shall be with them and be their Elohim.\n\nAnd I saw no Dwelling Place in it, for יהוה Ěl Shaddai is its Dwelling Place, and the Lamb. And the city had no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it, for the esteem of Elohim lightened it, and the Lamb is its lamp.\n\n“Blessed are those doing His commands, so that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of life, and to enter through the gates into the city.\n\nThe favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with the set-apart ones. Amĕn.\n\nWhen the Feast of Tabernacles is fulfilled.\n\nHe will once again fill the creation with His presence.\nThe sun will never sets on that Seventh Day Rest.\n“Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their array.” - Genesis 2\n\nConnections",

Lexham Press. Kindle Edition.\nReaders may have already anticipated that the angel in whom Yahweh’s name, his presence, dwells can be identified as the mysterious figure encountered by Joshua just before the wars of conquest. I would agree. Here is the passage in Joshua 5:\nAn important clue to identifying this “man” as the angel of Yahweh is the drawn sword in his hand. The Hebrew phrase here occurs only two other times: Numbers 22:23 and 1 Chronicles 21:16. Both explicitly name the Angel of Yahweh as the one with “drawn sword” in hand.\nThe wording comes from Exodus 3:5, the burning bush passage. The angel of Yahweh was in that bush.\n(Judges 2:1 – 4). The angel of Yahweh’s departure signaled an end to the regular presence of Yahweh with Israel. But even in the dark period of the judges he wouldn’t stay away completely. The call of Gideon in Judges 6 includes one appearance during this period. That there are two clearly separate Yahweh figures becomes more dramatic after verse 19.\nThe angel of Yahweh burns up the sacrifice and then leaves (v. 21). But we learn in verse 23 that Yahweh is still there and speaks to Gideon after the Angel’s departure.",

Lexham Press. Kindle Edition.\nWhile visual appearances in human form are more common,8 the New Testament also describes episodes where angels are best understood as corporeal. In Matthew 4:11, angels came to Jesus after he was tempted by the devil and “ministered” to him (cf. Mark 1:13). Surely this means more than floating around before Jesus’ face. Angels appear and speak (Matt 28:5; Luke 1:11–21, 30–38), instances that presume actual sound waves being created. If a merely auditory experience was meant, one would expect the communication to be described as a dream-vision (Acts 10:3).

LEXHAM PRESS. KINDLE EDITION.\nThe word “Azazel” in the Hebrew text can be translated “the goat that goes away.”\n“Azazel” is really a proper name. In Lev 16:8 one goat is “for Yahweh,” while the other goat is “for Azazel.”\nAzazel is regarded as the name of a demon in the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient Jewish books.\nAzazel is the leader of the angels that sinned in Genesis 6:1 – 4. The same description appears in the book of 1 Enoch (8:1; 9:6; 10:4 – 8; 13:1; 54:5 – 6; 55:4; 69:2).\nScholars have, however, connected the name to Mot, the god of death.\nThe goat for Azazel banished the sins of the Israelites to the realm outside Israel. Why? Because the ground on which Yahweh had his dwelling was holy. Sin had to be “transported” to where evil belonged—the territory outside Israel, under the control of gods set over the pagan nations. The high priest was not sacrificing to Azazel. Rather, Azazel was getting what belonged to him: sin.\nConnections\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/beings/adversary/\">Adversary</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/appointed-time/day-of-atonement/\">Day of Atonement</a>",

The Dragon's Prophecy: Israel, the Dark Resurrection, and the End of Days (pp. 33-34). Charisma House. Kindle Edition.\nA s the word tanim can mean both dragon and serpent, so in Revelation the Devil is called both the Dragon and the Serpent. When the Hebrew Scriptures were translated into Greek, the Hebrew tanim became the Greek drakohn, or dragon. In the New Testament the word appears only in the Book of Revelation and mostly in one section—the vision of the Dragon and the woman of Revelation 12.\nBP: Heaven and Earth Class\n\nW ith Marduk, he's fighting the dragon. But remember the dragon is a symbol of— Tiamat is the waters, the waters. So, there's this motif of the divine mastery of the waters is what shows that your God is the most powerful God on the block kind of thing. And so if God's house is in or on the waters— if the waters are summoned to give their allegiance and praise to Yahweh, this is— God is the master of the waters. This is the language that we're in here.\nY ou can talk about the chaos waters as the waters themselves or about the most dangerous creature in those waters and you get the symbol of the dragon.\nw e're also participating in a Canaanite, Babylonian thing here. There—it's a widespread motif of these dangerous creatures in the waters become symbolic of the forces of disorder or death or chaos. And so imagery and stories about my chief god slaying the sea dragon is a very widespread motif. So it makes perfect sense why the biblical authors in their context would draw on this. So these are just two images. They're both from even pre-Israelite times.\nI n the Hebrew Bible there are multiple ways that dragon imagery can be brought up. Monster imagery. The main point is to say Yahweh is more powerful than any forces of disorder and death. So Genesis 1, the dragon taming strategy is to say, &quot;It's not a god, it's not a deity.&quot; The dragon is a deity in all these stories.\nS o, it's another one of these elbow jabs, just like we don't name the sun and the moon. The tannin, he's not a thing. He's just a creature.\nW hen God is boasting about his creation to Job and about the marvels there's two creatures that God gives these long speeches about. Behemoth (laughs) and Leviathan. And in the chapter on Leviathan it begins in chapter Job 41; Leviathan is a synonym for tannin.\nSo the whole point, the strategy here is it's not a god, it's not a rival to Yahweh. It's a creature. Now, it's a dangerous creature. It'll kill you.\nSo we're in the realm of acknowledging that creation is still dangerous. It seems like it can thwart God's purposes 'cause sometimes it'll kill us. But despite the fact that our lives can be ended by it, it is not rival to Yahweh's mastery over the waters. So one strategy is to say, &quot;It's not a thing, it's a creature in the waters that he blesses and they're happy out there, let him play.&quot; So that's one strategy. There are other strategies when you really wanna pump up Yahweh's mastery, where you depict him as destroying and hacking into pieces the chaos monster. There are two ways of making the same theological point that Yahweh is the master of the waters, and he has the ability to confront it. Which is why the poet of Psalm 74 is so anguished. Why won't you do it again? Please do it again.\nIn the Bible, water and sea beasts function as evocative symbols of overwhelming and powerful chaos-inducing forces.\nIsaiah 27\nRevelation 12 - Jesus is overcoming this enormous dragon with seven heads and ten horns and crowns. And it's trying to devour up a little child that's coming from the woman, but instead the child is whisked away so that it can grow and eventually overcome the dragon.\nThere's dangerous dragons that represent death and pain and evil, but they aren't God. God's the master of those forces. And he's working out a plan through Jesus to vanquish the dragon. And meanwhile, we join the poet of Psalm 74— Yeah? And we just beg Yahweh to do it again. (laughs) Overcome the dragon again in our communities, in my own life, in my body, in our hearts, and in our minds.",

Return of the Gods. Christma Media. Kindle Edition\n\nIn the Hebrew Scriptures the word for God is Elohim. Elohim is plural. It speaks of the one true God in His transcendence and limitlessness. But the same word, translated as “God,” is in other contexts, translated as “the gods.” The strange property of the word reveals a profound truth. In the end, it will come down to one Elohim or the other - the Elohim of God or the elohim of the gods.\nIn his song of praise to God, Moses asked, “Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods?” Exodus 15:11\nJesus/Yeshua was different\nHe walked among them in flesh.\nHe didn’t demand he be given a sacrifice, he gave his life as a sacrifice.\nHe didn’t take life, he gave life.\nevery event has be makred and dated by its relation to His birth.\n\nHeiser, Michael S.. The Unseen Realm: Recovering the Supernatural Worldview of the Bible. Lexham Press. Kindle Edition.\nThis is not to say that an elohim could not interact with the human world. The Bible makes it clear that divine beings can (and did) assume physical human form, and even corporeal flesh, for interaction with people, but that is not their normal estate. Spiritual beings are “spirits” (1 Kgs 22:19–22; John 4:24; Heb 1:14; Rev 1:4).\nThe biblical writers refer to a half-dozen different entities with the word elohim. By any religious accounting, the attributes of those entities are not equal.\n\nYahweh, the God of Israel (thousands of times—e.g., Gen 2:4–5; Deut 4:35)\nThe members of Yahweh’s council (Psa 82:1, 6)\nGods and goddesses of other nations (Judg 11:24; 1 Kgs 11:33)\nDemons (Hebrew: shedim—Deut 32:17)3\nThe deceased Samuel (1 Sam 28:13)\nAngels or the Angel of Yahweh4 (Gen 35:7)\n\nWe saw earlier that the Hebrew Bible uses the term elohim to speak of any inhabitant of the spiritual world. The word itself provides no differentiation among beings within that realm, though hierarchy is certainly present. Yahweh, for example, is an elohim, but no other elohim is Yahweh. Nevertheless, the term elohim tells us very little about how an ancient reader would have parsed the pecking order of theunseenrealm. The same is true of certain Greek terms that are used in the New Testament.1\n20 Mapped Links\n↑ Demon\n→ Unclean Spirit\n↑ Return of the Gods\n→ Elohim\n\n← 1 Corinthians 10\n← Deuteronomy 32\n← Psalm 106\n\n↓ Anu\n↓ Ashtaroth\n↓ Baal\n↓ Bull\n↓ Dragon\n↓ Ereshkigal\n↓ Eros\n↓ Marduk\n↓ Molech\n↓ Ninshubar\n↓ Possessed\n↓ Serpent\n↓ Tammuz",

Kindle Edition.\nT he word translated “messiah” (mashiach) is fairly common in the Old Testament. It occurs over three dozen times. It simply means “anointed.”\nN otes on Usage\nT he term mashiach in the Hebrew Bible primarily denotes someone anointed with oil for a divine purpose, such as kings (e.g., Saul, David, Solomon) or priests (e.g., Aaron and his successors). It does not inherently carry the later theological connotations of a singular &quot;Messiah&quot; as developed in Second Temple Judaism or Christianity, though David’s line (e.g., Psalm 89:20-38) lays groundwork for such expectations.\nT he anointing process typically involves pouring oil on the head (e.g., 1 Samuel 10:1, Exodus 29:7), symbolizing divine selection and empowerment.\nI n some cases, the term mashiach is implied through the act of anointing rather than explicitly stated (e.g., Solomon, Joash). I included these figures where the context strongly aligns with the mashiach concept.\nN o prophets are explicitly called mashiach in the Hebrew Bible, though Elijah is commanded to anoint Elisha (1 Kings 19:16), but the text does not confirm this anointing or use the term mashiach for Elisha.\nT he picture of messiah begins to appear:\n\nCharacters Referred to as Mashiach in the Hebrew Bible\n\nSaul\n\nReference: 1 Samuel 9:16, 10:1, 12:3, 12:5, 24:6, 24:10, 26:9, 26:11, 26:16, 26:23; 2 Samuel 1:14, 1:16\n\nContext: Saul, the first king of Israel, is anointed by Samuel at God's command. The term mashiach is explicitly used for Saul in several passages, such as 1 Samuel 24:6, where David refers to Saul as &quot;the LORD’s anointed&quot; (יהוה משיחו, YHWH’s mashiach). This highlights Saul’s divinely appointed kingship, despite his later failings.\n\n2. David\n\nReference: 1 Samuel 16:6, 16:12-13; 2 Samuel 2:4, 5:3, 19:21, 22:51, 23:1; Psalm 18:50, 89:20, 89:38, 89:51\nContext: David is anointed by Samuel to be king (1 Samuel 16:13) and is frequently called mashiach in the text, such as in 2 Samuel 22:51 (&quot;He shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever&quot;) and Psalm 89:20 (&quot;I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him&quot;). David is a central figure associated with the term, and his line is linked to messianic expectations in later texts.\n\n3. Solomon\n\nReference: 1 Kings 1:34, 1:39, 1 Chronicles 29:22\nContext: Solomon is anointed as king (1 Kings 1:39, &quot;Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon&quot;). While the term mashiach is not always directly applied in these verses, the act of anointing and the context of kingship imply it, as seen in other royal anointing passages. 1 Chronicles 29:22 explicitly describes Solomon’s anointing as king.\n\n4. Joash (Jehoash)\n\nReference: 2 Kings 11:12; 2 Chronicles 23:11\nContext: Joash, a king of Judah, is anointed by Jehoiada the priest during his coronation at a young age (2 Kings 11:12, &quot;Then he brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony. And they proclaimed him king and anointed him&quot;). The anointing signifies his role as a divinely appointed king, aligning with the mashiach concept.\n\n5. Hazael\n\nReference: 1 Kings 19:15-16\nContext: God instructs Elijah to anoint Hazael as king over Syria (Aram). While the text does not explicitly confirm the anointing took place, the command to anoint him suggests Hazael’s designation as a mashiach in the sense of a divinely appointed ruler, albeit a foreign one.\n\n6. Jehu\n\nReference: 1 Kings 19:16; 2 Kings 9:3, 9:6, 9:12\nContext: Jehu is anointed as king over Israel by a prophet sent by Elisha (2 Kings 9:6, &quot;Then he arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on his head and said to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel’&quot;). The term mashiach is implied through the anointing act, marking Jehu as God’s chosen instrument to judge the house of Ahab.\n\n7. Cyrus the Great\n\nReference: Isaiah 45:1\nContext: Cyrus, the Persian king, is uniquely called God’s mashiach in Isaiah 45:1: &quot;Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him.&quot; This is a rare instance where a non-Israelite is explicitly called mashiach, reflecting his role in God’s plan to deliver Israel from Babylonian exile.\n\n8. High Priests (Aaron and His Descendants)\n\nReference: Leviticus 4:3, 4:5, 4:16, 6:22; Exodus 28:41, 29:7, 30:30\nContext: The high priest is referred to as &quot;the anointed priest&quot; (hakkohen hamashiach, הכהן המשיח) in Leviticus. For example, Leviticus 4:3 mentions &quot;the anointed priest&quot; in the context of sin offerings. Exodus 29:7 describes Aaron’s anointing: &quot;You shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him.&quot; The high priestly role, particularly Aaron and his sons, is consistently associated with mashiach due to their anointing for sacred service.\n\nNotes on Usage\n\nThe term mashiach in the Hebrew Bible primarily denotes someone anointed with oil for a divine purpose, such as kings (e.g., Saul, David, Solomon) or priests (e.g., Aaron and his successors). It does not inherently carry the later theological connotations of a singular &quot;Messiah&quot; as developed in Second Temple Judaism or Christianity, though David’s line (e.g., Psalm 89:20-38) lays groundwork for such expectations.\nThe anointing process typically involves pouring oil on the head (e.g., 1 Samuel 10:1, Exodus 29:7), symbolizing divine selection and empowerment.\nIn some cases, the term mashiach is implied through the act of anointing rather than explicitly stated (e.g., Solomon, Joash). I included these figures where the context strongly aligns with the mashiach concept.\nNo prophets are explicitly called mashiach in the Hebrew Bible, though Elijah is commanded to anoint Elisha (1 Kings 19:16), but the text does not confirm this anointing or use the term mashiach for Elisha.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe Hebrew Bible does not use mashiach in a singular, eschatological sense (e.g., a future redeemer figure) as seen in later traditions. Passages like Isaiah 9:6-7 or Micah 5:2 are often interpreted messianically in later contexts but do not explicitly use mashiach.\nSome figures (e.g., other kings of Israel or Judah) may have been anointed but are not explicitly described as such in the text, so they are not included here (e.g., Hezekiah, Josiah).\n\nIf you want further details on any specific character or passage, let me know!\n12 Mapped Links\n↑ Joseph of Jesus\n↑ Mary of Jesus\n\n← Fulfill\n← J\n\n↓ Christ\n↓ HaMoshiach\n↓ Iamsaves\n↓ Messiah\n↓ Son of Man\n↓ The Son\n↓ Yehoshua\n↓ ישוע המשיח",

Instead, the notion is metaphorical or spiritual. And this is precisely what we see when the phrase occurs elsewhere in the Bible. The metaphor is perhaps most clear in the New Testament, when Jesus himself referred to the Pharisees as serpents (Matt 23:33) who were “of [their] father the devil” (John 8:44; cf.

Not only direct borrowings took place, but also creative interpretations, especially on the Jewish side... [T]hese were deliberate inversions of Mesopotamian traditions. The Jewish authors often inverted the Mesopotamian myths, with the intention of showing the superi ority of their own cultural foundations …” The point was to turn the Mesopo tamian belief system on its head, to make sure that Israelites and Jewish readers would know that what happened between the sons of God and the daughters of humankind was not something the bettered humanity. It was the opposite—a transgression of heaven and earth that would corrupt humankind and produce a lineage that would later become a threat to the very existence of Israel, Yahweh’s people and portion. — MICHAEL HEISER, REVERSING HERMON, PP. 49-51, WITH EMBEDDED QUOTE FROM AMAR ANNUS, “ON THE ORIGIN OF THE WATCHERS.”\n\nHeavenly Beings\nWatcher - Ir; watches what is going on or whatever they are tasked to watch.

		"content": "4 BC-31 AD\nA Christian Walk with the Tabernacle Israelite Common People\nEden and The Tabernacle\nL et’s take another look at the overlay of Eden and the Tabernacle.\n\nE ast of Eden is where Cain was expelled to. This is earth. Earth does not mean the big blue ball floating out in space. Earth is where man is.\nE arth is where man’s law reigns.\nW e are going to talk about the access to the Outer Courts today. Outer Courts = East of Eden\nM any people live in these outer courts. Confessing with their mouth but not with their lives. They continue to go back and forth between Outside and the Outer Courts.\nT hese people had access to the Outer Courts. The only way they could enter is by coming to the gate with an offering.\nA Christian Walk with the Tabernacle Israelites\n\nJ ust from looking at the people, the way the camp and the tabernacle were set up, we can see God’s path to a relationship with him. It starts with Jesus, but Jesus is not the destination, he is the way to the destination. Over in the orange area, we are on Earth, the further we move toward the purple area, the close we get to Heaven. Heaven means the place where God Reigns. In this case, it isn’t a place, it is a state of being.\n\nW e start out on the outside, the lost foreigner, gentile, living in our fleshly desires, All about our will being done.\n\nThen we move to the outer Court Gate as a called out person. Just like the Tribes of Israel were brought out of bondate, God is calling us out of bondage out of our own wants.\n\nAs we answer that call, we come to the gate and are inspected. Jesus has stepped up to offer his blood as a covering so we can enter in with confidence. We are now a part of the Called out Group, we’ve been adopted as the chose people of YHWH. This is where we start to give up our old personalities, our old character, and our old way of life - we give God our heart and decide to love the Lord our God with all our hearts. But this isn’t where we stay.\n\nWe can move confidently into the Set-apart place and become part of the Called out Body of Christ, the royal priesthood, the set apart people. We give over our appetitles and our desires, our stubborn wills and Love the lord our God with all our soul or will and strength. As priests, we begin to teach other Gods ways and his right rullings.\n\nThen we move into the most set-apart place with the Called out Life, we begin to dress and act differently as we function as the High Priests did as we move as one with our High Priest Jesus. We give over our minds to God. Our minds would be our thoughts and our feelings our habitual inclinations in life. We Love the Lord our God with all our mind.\n\nAs we move into this area, this is where the earthly and the heavenly overlap. It brings up to being a Called out being the Raised up ones it’s where our walking in the Spirit, thrown off the fleshly ways, and are about YHWH’s will being done. This is where the Garden of Eden was. It was a place where the flesh could walk and talk with God. This is what Jesus was talking about when he said The Kingdom of Heaven is near. If we heard someones say this today in our terms, it would sound more like God Reigns is near. All you have to do is answer his call and let God reign in your heart, your soul, will, and strength, and in your heart. Let God’s reign come,\n\nThe set up of the Tabernacle can show us just how close or far away we are in our relationship with God.\nSo where are you are in your walk?\nThe Tabernacle\nLet’s talk about Jesus and access to the Tabernacle.\n\nJesus has identified himself as our Passover Lamb. If you recall, in the Exodus Story the Lambs blood was put on the threshold of the homes so that death would passover them and not kill the first born in their home. There were no requirements on anyone in the household outside of participating in sacrificing the lamb. If they were in a house with blood on the threshold, they were passed over. Those people were then lead out of bondage and set free.\nThis is exactly what Jesus did, he provided his blood as the sacrificial lamb. That is made available to anyone and everyone. Those who want to enter the Kingdom of God come with their offering (Jesus) and they have access to the Kingdom. There is no access to the Kingdom without an offering.\nThe problem is, the people who only access the Outer Courts, keep coming back because again, they confess with their mouths, but do not change their old ways.\nThey agree to follow God’s law, and then turn right around and create an idol. In a previous video, I referred to these people as the MY way people.n a previous video, I referred to these people as the MY way people.\nThey participate in offering the passover land, they put the blood over their threshold. They are then lead out of bondage and set free, only to long for their bondage or return to the bondage. If you have not read Exodus, I encourage you to do so. There is very little you will see in the movies and animations created to try to tell the story.\nAt this time, Jesus had not fulfilled the passover lamb requirements, but God had other requirements for the Israelites to be able to enter the outer courts.\n\n29 Mapped Links\n↑ Divine Council\n→ Heavenly Hosts\n→ Sons of God\n↑ God\n→ Hashem\n→ Holy Great One\n↑ Heavenly Beings\n→ Adversary of YHWH\n→ Angel\n→ Anti-Christ\n→ Ashtaroth\n→ Baal\n→ Cheribum\n→ Demon\n→ Luminaries\n→ Messenger\n→ Molech\n→ Nephilim\n→ Seraphim\n→ Sons of God\n→ Spiritual Beings\n→ Stars\n→ Watchers\n→ With YHWH\n↑ Return of the Gods\n→ Shedim\n\n← E\n← YHWH\n\n↓ Ruakh\n↓ Yehoshua",

Abimelech takes Sarah into his household, intending to marry her (Genesis 20:2).\nGod appears to Abimelech in a dream, warning him that Sarah is Abraham’s wife and threatening judgment unless he returns her. Abimelech, unaware of the deception, protests his innocence (Genesis 20:3-7).\nAbimelech confronts Abraham, who explains his fear-driven lie. Abimelech returns Sarah, gives Abraham livestock, silver, and land near Gerar as restitution, and allows him to dwell there (Genesis 20:8-16). Abraham prays for Abimelech, and God heals him and his household from barrenness caused by the incident (Genesis 20:17-18).\n\nSome time later, after Isaac’s birth, Abimelech, accompanied by his commander Phicol, recognizes Abraham’s prosperity and God’s favor.\n\nAbimelech approaches Abraham, acknowledging that God is with him, and proposes a treaty: “Swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned” (Genesis 21:23).\nAbraham agrees but raises a grievance about a well his servants had dug, which Abimelech’s servants had seized. They settle the matter with an oath, and Abraham gives Abimelech seven ewe lambs as a witness to his claim over the well (Genesis 21:25-30).\nThey make a covenant at Beersheba (“well of the oath”). Abraham plants a tamarisk tree and calls on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God, signifying a lasting peace (Genesis 21:31-33). Abimelech and Phicol return to Philistia.\n\nIn Genesis 26:12-22, Isaac prospers in Gerar, digging wells that lead to conflicts with the Philistines over water rights. The herdsmen of Gerar quarrel with Isaac’s servants, and he moves to avoid escalation, naming a well Rehoboth (“room”) after finding peace\n\nGraphics\nPictures",

When Abram believes God, it is “counted to him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6), a key verse cited in Romans 4:3 and Galatians 3:6 to highlight his faith.\nIn Genesis 17, God changes Abram’s name to Abraham (“father of a multitude”) and establishes circumcision as the covenant sign. God promises Abraham a son through Sarah, Isaac, and that his descendants will possess Canaan.\nIn Genesis 22:15-18, after Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac, God reiterates the promise, emphasizing that all nations will be blessed through his offspring.\n\nEvents in History\n\nEgypt: In Genesis 12:10-20, due to famine, Abraham goes to Egypt and, fearing for his life, asks Sarai to say she is his sister. Pharaoh takes her but is afflicted by God, and Abraham leaves with wealth after the truth is revealed. A similar incident occurs with Abimelech in Genesis 20.\nLot’s Separation: In Genesis 13, Abraham and Lot separate due to land disputes. Abraham generously lets Lot choose first, and Lot picks the Jordan Valley. God then reaffirms the land promise to Abraham.\nRescue of Lot: In Genesis 14, Abraham defeats kings who captured Lot, showing his leadership and bravery. He meets Melchizedek, priest-king of Salem, who blesses him, and Abraham gives him a tithe.\nHagar and Ishmael: In Genesis 16, impatient for an heir, Abraham, at Sarai’s urging, fathers Ishmael through Hagar, Sarai’s servant. God later blesses Ishmael but clarifies Isaac as the covenant heir (Genesis 17:19-21).\nSodom and Gomorrah: In Genesis 18-19, Abraham intercedes with God to spare Sodom, showing his compassion and boldness. God destroys the cities but spares Lot.\nIsaac’s Birth and Sacrifice: In Genesis 21, Sarah bears Isaac, the promised son. In Genesis 22, God tests Abraham by commanding him to sacrifice Isaac. Abraham obeys but is stopped by God, who provides a ram instead, affirming Abraham’s faith.\nSarah’s Death and Burial: In Genesis 23, Abraham mourns Sarah’s death and purchases the cave of Machpelah to bury her, securing a foothold in Canaan.\nKeturah and Later Life: In Genesis 25:1-6, Abraham marries Keturah, who bears six sons. He sends their descendants away with gifts, ensuring Isaac’s inheritance. Abraham dies at 175 (Genesis 25:7-8) and is buried with Sarah.\n\nCharts\n\nSecular Year\nJewish Year\nEvent in History\n\n-1813\n1948\nAbraham (son of Terah) was born (https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112356/jewish/Who-Was-Abraham-The-First-Patriarch-in-the-Bible.htm)\n\n-1803\n1958\nSarah (daughter of Haran) was born (https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112508/jewish/Sarah-of-the-Bible-The-First-Matriarch.htm)\n\n-1788\n1973\nAbraham married Sarah (https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112356/jewish/Who-Was-Abraham-The-First-Patriarch-in-the-Bible.htm)\n\n-1765\n1996\nDispersion from Babel after building the tower (https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246611/jewish/The-Tower-Of-Babel.htm)\n\n-1761\n2000\nTerah <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Terah</a> left Ur Kasdim with his family\n\n-1755\n2006\nNoah <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Noah</a> died\n\nDiagrams\n\nTags",

		"url":"/gate-of-wisdom/beings/human-beings/babylonians/",
		"content": "Birth and Ancestors\n\nFirst Mention and Origin: The Babylonians trace back to the city of Babel in the land of Shinar, founded by Nimrod, a mighty hunter and descendant of Noah through Ham (Genesis 10:8-10). Nimrod’s kingdom included Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh in Shinar, establishing Babylon as a significant early city.\nTower of Babel: The people of Babel, unified in language, attempted to build a tower reaching the heavens to make a name for themselves, defying God’s command to spread out (Genesis 11:1-9). God confused their language, scattering them, and the city was called Babel (meaning &quot;confusion&quot;).\n\nMajor Storylines\n\nEarly Reference: Babylon (Babel) appears in Genesis as a symbol of human pride and rebellion against God (Genesis 11:1-9). The city’s early significance is tied to this event, marking it as a center of opposition to divine authority.\nBabylon as an Empire: By the time of the prophets, Babylon emerges as a dominant empire, particularly under Nebuchadnezzar II. It becomes the instrument of God’s judgment against Judah and other nations for their disobedience and idolatry.\n\nJudah’s Exile: Babylon, under King Nebuchadnezzar, conquers Judah and Jerusalem. The Babylonian army besieges Jerusalem multiple times, leading to its fall (2 Kings 24:1-20; 25:1-21; 2 Chronicles 36:6-21; Jeremiah 39:1-10). Key events include:\n\nJehoiakim’s rebellion, leading to his subjugation (2 Kings 24:1).\nJehoiachin’s surrender and exile to Babylon with the elite (2 Kings 24:10-16, c. 597 BCE).\nZedekiah’s rebellion, resulting in Jerusalem’s destruction, the temple’s burning, and mass exile (2 Kings 25:1-21; Jeremiah 52:4-30, c. 587 BCE).\n\nDaniel and the Exiles: The Book of Daniel highlights Babylonian rule through the experiences of Daniel and other Jewish exiles. Nebuchadnezzar takes young nobles, including Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, to serve in his court (Daniel 1:1-7). They demonstrate faithfulness to God amidst Babylonian culture.\n\nNebuchadnezzar’s dream of a statue (Daniel 2) reveals Babylon as the &quot;head of gold,&quot; signifying its supremacy but temporary reign, to be succeeded by other empires.\nThe fiery furnace (Daniel 3) shows Nebuchadnezzar’s idolatry (a golden image) and God’s deliverance of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\nNebuchadnezzar’s pride and subsequent madness (Daniel 4) depict God’s sovereignty over Babylonian power.\nBelshazzar’s feast (Daniel 5) marks Babylon’s fall to the Medes and Persians, with the &quot;writing on the wall&quot; signaling divine judgment.\n\nProphetic Context:\nProphets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Habakkuk emphasize Babylon’s role as both God’s instrument and a nation doomed for its pride and wickedness:\n- Isaiah prophesies Babylon’s future desolation (Isaiah 13:1-22; 14:22-23) and mocks its king (likely symbolic of its power, Isaiah 14:4-21).\n- Jeremiah details Babylon’s conquest of Judah and its eventual destruction (Jeremiah 50-51).\n- Habakkuk questions God’s use of the &quot;wicked&quot; Babylonians to judge Judah, learning of their coming judgment (Habakkuk 1:5-11; 2:6-20).\nSymbolic Babylon:\nIn the New Testament, Babylon symbolizes spiritual and moral corruption, often associated with a system opposing God (Revelation 17:1-18; 18:1-24). It represents a city or power that seduces nations but faces ultimate judgment.\nMilitary\n\nPower and Conquest: The Bible portrays the Babylonian military as formidable and ruthless:\n\nHabakkuk 1:6-11 describes them as a &quot;fierce and impetuous&quot; people, dreaded and swift, with skilled horsemen and warriors who conquer like eagles.\nJeremiah 6:22-23 and 50:42 depict them as a cruel, well-armed force with bows and spears, coming from the north to execute judgment.\nTheir sieges of Jerusalem (2 Kings 24:10-11; 25:1-7; Jeremiah 39:1-2) show advanced military tactics, including prolonged sieges, battering rams, and breaching city walls.\n\nConquests: Babylon subjugates Judah, surrounding nations (Jeremiah 27:5-11), and cities like Tyre (Ezekiel 26:7-11). Nebuchadnezzar’s campaigns establish Babylon as a dominant regional power.\nFall of Babylon: Daniel 5:30-31 records Babylon’s sudden fall to the Medes and Persians under Cyrus, fulfilling prophecies of its defeat (Isaiah 21:9; Jeremiah 51:8).\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nCultural and Religious Influence: Babylonians are depicted as idolatrous, with Nebuchadnezzar erecting a golden image for worship (Daniel 3:1-7). Their culture, including divination and sorcery, contrasts with Israelite faith (Daniel 1:20; 2:2).\nGod’s Sovereignty: The Bible consistently frames Babylon’s rise and fall as under God’s control. They are used to punish Judah but are judged for their arrogance and cruelty (Jeremiah 25:12-14; 50:18).\nKey Figures:\n\nNebuchadnezzar: Central figure, portrayed as a powerful but prideful king humbled by God (Daniel 4:30-37).\nBelshazzar: Last Babylonian king, whose blasphemous feast leads to Babylon’s fall (Daniel 5:1-30).\n\nExile and Return: The Babylonian captivity lasts 70 years, as prophesied (Jeremiah 25:11-12; 29:10). After Babylon’s fall, Cyrus allows the Jews to return to Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 36:22-23; Ezra 1:1-4).",

Jacob loved her and worked seven years for Laban to marry her, but was deceived into marrying Leah first. He then worked another seven years for Rachel (Genesis 29:20-30). Rachel faced barrenness initially but later bore children (Genesis 30:1-24).\nChildren:\n\nJoseph (Genesis 30:24)\nBenjamin (Genesis 35:18)\n\nOther Descendants of Note:\n\nJoseph’s sons: Manasseh and Ephraim (Genesis 41:50-52)\n\nLand and Dwelling\nJourneys\n\nFrom Haran to Canaan with Jacob (Genesis 31:17-18)\nFrom Bethel toward Ephrath, where she died during childbirth (Genesis 35:16-19)\n\nMaps\n\nHaran: Southeastern Turkey, where Rachel lived initially\nCanaan: Modern-day Israel/Palestine, where she journeyed with Jacob\nEphrath (Bethlehem): Near Jerusalem, where she died\n\nMedical and Death\n\nRachel was barren for a time (Genesis 30:1-2).\nShe died giving birth to Benjamin near Ephrath, suffering great pain (Genesis 35:16-19).\nBuried on the way to Ephrath (Bethlehem).\nHer tomb near Bethlehem is noted (Genesis 35:19-20)\n\nRighteousness and Unrighteousness\nRighteousness\n\nUnrighteousness\n\nStole her father’s household idols (Genesis 31:19, 34-35), deceiving Jacob and Laban\nExpressed envy and frustration over her barrenness (Genesis 30:1)\n\nOther\n\nRachel was a shepherdess (Genesis 29:9).\nDescribed as beautiful in form and appearance (Genesis 29:17).\n\nArcheology\nRachel's Tomb: The Primary Site of Interest\n\nLocation and Tradition: The most prominent site associated with Rachel is a shrine north of Bethlehem, Israel, traditionally identified as her burial place based on Genesis 35:19 (&quot;buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem&quot;). This site has been venerated by Jews, Christians, and Muslims for over 1,500 years, with the earliest extra-biblical references dating to the 4th century CE.\n\n4th Century CE: Eusebius (church historian) and the Bordeaux Pilgrim (a Christian travelogue) describe a monument to Rachel near Bethlehem, marking it as a pilgrimage spot.\nMadaba Map (6th Century CE): This Byzantine mosaic map of the Holy Land depicts a structure labeled as Rachel's tomb on the road to Bethlehem.\nDebate on Authenticity: Scholars like those from the Biblical Archaeology Society note the tradition likely originated in the Byzantine era, not the biblical period. Alternative northern locations (e.g., near Ramah in Benjamin's territory, per 1 Samuel 10:2 and Jeremiah 31:15) have been proposed, with 19th-century explorers like Clermont-Ganneau suggesting dolmens there as candidates, but none have yielded Rachel-specific evidence.\n\nCultural and Textual Contexts (Non-Biblical Parallels)\n\nMesopotamian Marriage Contracts: Rachel's story (e.g., Jacob's 14 years of labor for her hand in Genesis 29-30) mirrors ancient Near Eastern customs. Cuneiform tablets from Nuzi and Emar (15th-14th century BCE) describe bride-price labor, surrogate childbearing via handmaids (like Bilhah for Rachel), and inheritance disputes between sisters—parallels analyzed in Kristine Henriksen Garroway's work for the Biblical Archaeology Society (2022). These suggest the narrative draws from real Bronze Age practices but provide no direct evidence for Rachel herself.",

		"content": "Define\n\nHebrew: hêlēl (הֵילֵל) it refers to a “shining one” or “morning star”\n\ncomes from the root הָלַל (halal), which means “to shine” or “to give light.”\n\nGreek: heōsphoros (ἑωσφόρος) means “light-bringer” or “morning star” (from heōs = dawn and phoros = bearer).\n\nRelated words\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/beings/heavenly-beings/lucifer/\">Lucifer</a>\n\nAdditional Info\n\nOften associated with Venus, the planet visible at dawn\nThere is no being named &quot;Lucifer&quot; recorded in scripture.\n\nAround 405 AD. the Latin Vulgate translated ἑωσφόρος as lucifer (from Latin lux = light and ferre = to bear), which is where the English term “Lucifer” originates.\nEarly Christian interpreters allegorically extended this imagery to Satan's fall, drawing on New Testament references like Luke 10:18 (&quot;I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven&quot;) and traditions of a rebellious angel.\nThis interpretation builds on pseudepigrapha (non-canonical texts like the Life of Adam and Eve, dated to the 1st century AD or earlier), which describe a fallen angelic figure tempting humanity.\n\nChurch Fathers like Justin Martyr (c. 150 AD) and Irenaeus (c. 180 AD) discuss Satan as a fallen angel but do not tie it to the &quot;morning star&quot; imagery.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Origen of Alexandria</a> (c. 185–253 AD), a foundational Christian theologian, is widely recognized as the first to explicitly use &quot;Lucifer&quot; as a proper name for the Devil in an allegorical sense. In his treatise De Principiis (On First Principles), particularly in the Proemium (Preface) and a homily on Ezekiel (Book XII), Origen connects the &quot;morning star&quot; (Eosphorus-Lucifer in Greek/Latin) from Isaiah 14:12 with Satan. This marks the shift from a literal Babylonian king to an allegorical prototype for the Devil.\n\nJerome's Vulgate (c. 405 AD): Jerome adopts Origen's view in his commentary on Isaiah, solidifying &quot;Lucifer&quot; as Satan's name in Western Christianity. His translation popularized the term, though he knew the Hebrew context was historical.\n\nConnections\n\nIsaiah 14:12 used metaphorically to describe the fallen king of Babylon - v4: &quot;this parable against the king of Babylon&quot;\n2 Peter 1:19 - similar imagery but different word phosphoros (φωσφόρος) meaning “light-bringing,”\nRevelation 22:16 -similar imagery but different word astēr ho prōinos (ἀστὴρ ὁ πρωϊνός) meaning “morning star”\nNo other verses in the Hebrew Bible use הֵילֵל, and the Greek ἑωσφόρος is used only in the Septuagint for Isaiah 14:12.",

As such, it may also be used to describe the final result of a process (bind them into bundles, MATTHEW 13:30) or the upper limit of a clause or condition (guilty as hell, MATTHEW 5.\n\nIsaiah 1\n\nVerses 9-15\nMatthew 5:23 If you are offering your gift...\nMatthew 9:13 Mercy not sacrifice;\nMatthew 12:7, 33, mercy not sacrifice;\nMark 1:44 Jesus instructs to go to the priest and offer sacrifice;\nMark 12:33 love Yah and love neighbors more important than burnt offerings and sacrifices;\nActs 7:39-51 Stiff-necked people - hearts and ears are uncircumcied;\nHebrews 10: sacrifices and offereing you did not desire, can not be repeated year after year, priest offer day after day, Jesus made one sacrifice for sins, forever, for those who are being made set-apart.

In Matthew 28, the verb form of disciple is used, we aren't told to make a disciple because you can't make a verb. We are told to disciple. Here, in Matthew 5, the noun form is used. A disciple is one who follows a teacher and wants to be their follower. To be a successful disciple, the goal is to be a replica of the teacher you have chosen to follow. Not wavering to the left or the right.\n\nMatthew b05 04\n\nMatthew 5:4 The Weeping – CalltoCeaseFire\n- Matthew 5:4 The Weeping\n\nMatthew b05 05\n\nMatthew 5:5 The Resting Ones – CalltoCeaseFire\n- Matthew 5:5 The Resting Ones\n\nMatthew b05 06\n\nMatthew 5:6 Hunger and Thirst – CalltoCeaseFire\n- Matthew 5:6 Hunger and Thirst\n\nMatthew 5:6 (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew 5%3A6&amp;version=YLT) `Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness -- because they shall be filled.\n\nMatthew b05 07\nMatthew 5:7 Merciful – CalltoCeaseFire\nMatthew 5:7 Merciful\n- Matthew b05 08\nMatthew 5:8 Pure at Heart – CalltoCeaseFire\nMatthew 5:8 Pure at Heart\n- Matthew b05 09\nMatthew 5:9 Peacemaker – CalltoCeaseFire\nMatthew 5:9 Peacemaker\n- Matthew b05 09a Note\nQuick Note: Matthew 5 Beatitudes and Sermon on the Mount – CalltoCeaseFire\n- Quick Note: Matthew 5 Beatitudes and Sermon on the Mount\n- Generally the Beatitudes are separated from the rest of Matthew 5, as well as Chapters 6 and 7 of Matthew containing the Sermon on the Mount. However, just as when we attend classes or lectures, everything builds upon each other.\n- Matthew b05 10-12\nMatthew 5:10-12 Persecuted for Righteousness – CalltoCeaseFire\nMatthew 5:10-12 Persecuted for Righteousness\n- What is righteousness? Earlier in Matthew 5, we were told those who hunger and thirst for righteousness are filled/satisfied. The Greek word implies justice and fairness. The Hebrew word is centered in being in right relationship both with YHWH/God and with others. By default, if we are not in right relationship with others, then we are not in right relationship with YHWH/God. It was a simple concept for the Jewish disciples listening to Jesus's torah/teaching.\n- Matthew b05 13\nMatthew 5:13 Salt – CalltoCeaseFire\nMatthew 5:13 Salt\n- More on Matthew 5 Salt\n- Matthew b05:13-20\nMATTHEW 5:13-20 LIGHTS - CITY - HEAVEN - EARTH\n- GENESIS - MATTHEW - REVELATION CONNECTIONS\nRead Matthew 5:14-16 Light of the World and\n- Matthew 5:17-20 Jesus - the Law and the Prophets first\n- There seems to be a connection between Genesis 1 and 2 and Revelation 21 and 22 to Matthew 5:13-20 passages. It is fascinating and worth peeking at and appreciating before we move on...\n- Matthew b05 14-16\nMatthew 5:14 Light of the World – CalltoCeaseFire\nMatthew 5:14 Light of the World\n- Nehemiah 9\n-- timeout: don't miss those hunger and thirst references here as well. this might be a really good chapter to read in tandem with Matthew 5 - what do you think?\n- Ezekiel 36\nBack to Ezekiel 36, just after that passage he says, I will cause the cities to be inhabited. They will say, 'This land that was a wasteland has become like the garden of Eden.' He says, the nations left around them will know that he is Adonai who has rebuilt the ruins and replanted the desolate. Now that is a picture that lines up with Matthew 5, and the city, the light, the good works, isn't it?\n- Second Writings/New Testament\nEphesians 5, says live as children of light and find out what pleases the Lord. The fruit of the light consists in all good ness, righteousness and truth. To have nothing to do with fruitless deeds of darkness but to expose them. This right here is sounding a little like being the salt earlier in Matthew 5. Although, at the time Jesus said these words written in Matthew, our current Second Writings/New Testament didn't exist, not everyone at that time would have made the connection we can today. John records Jesus calling himself the light of the world so we know he spoke about the light in other teachings.\n- Matthew b05 17-20\nMatthew 5:17-20 Jesus – the Law and the Prophets – CalltoCeaseFire\nMatthew 5:17-20 Jesus - the Law and the Prophets\n- Verse 18\nMatthew 5:25 translated as while - Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going.\n- Matthew b05:21-22\nMatthew 5:21-22 Jesus: Murder vs Anger\n- Matthew b05:23-26\nMatthew 5:23-26 Your Gift and Your Brother\n- The beginning of this thought line is here: Matthew 5:21-22 Jesus: Murder and Anger.\n- Matthew b05:33-37\nMatthew 5:33-37 Jesus: Swearing and Oaths\n- I would also imagine, of all the teaching found here in Matthew 5, this one is likely taken most lightly - its not something we consider to be significant. However, to God, it was seen as very significant.\n- Verse 37\nThe same root word is used here as the word repetitions we will see later in Matthew 5 - chatter, long winded, utter empty words, repeating the same things over and over, stammering.\n- Matthew b05:38-42\nMatthew 5:38-42 Jesus: Retaliation\n- Verses 40-42\nMatthew 5 – The Hebrew Gospels\n- Matthew b05:43-48\nMatthew 5:43-48 Jesus: Neighbors and Enemies\n- Matthew c05_01-02\nTITLE:\n3:33 Bible Study: The Disciple Matthew and Matthew 5:1-2\n- Quick overview on the Disciple Matthew and Matthew 5:1-2 in preparation in our study of Matthew Chapters 5-9.

Charisma House. Kindle Edition.\n\nSahtan\nThe English word Satan comes from the Hebrew sahtan, which can be translated as opponent, adversary, and enemy. The word goes to the heart of his essence.\nHe is not an enemy—but the Enemy, the one at enmity with all.\nWhen the ancient scribes had to translate the Hebrew sahtan into Greek, they chose the word Diabolos //Devil//.\nAs evil, by nature, stands in opposition to existence, so the name of the entity that personifies it means the Opponent, the Opposer, and which in Hebrew is sahtan or Satan. And as evil, by nature, stands in enmity with all that is, so the name of the being that embodies it is the Enemy, the Adversary, both of which are translations of sahtan and diabolos, Satan and the Devil.\n\nMy Observations and Opinions\n\nThere is a main adversary, usually referred to as dragon or serpent. And many satans/adversaries and stars (aka lucifers). And a THIRD of the stars were swept to earth by the Great Dragon's tail. And the Great Dragon and those with him were thrown to the earth. Reveationl 12:4\nThere are several main satans/adversaries named in the Bible, Azazel, Baal, Ashtaroth, Moloch, Beelzebub, to name a few of the more well known ones. They are all hasatans/satans. Anyone standing in opposition to Yah/God or as an accuser is a satan.\nNumbers 22:22 But the Af Elohim was kindled as he was going; and the Malach Hashem stood in the derech (road) ha’satan against him  - The Angel of the Lord is satan\n1 Samuel 29:4 - the Philistines are the satans\nLuke 10 - context: the disciples just came back from casting out demons - Jesus says, I was seeing the adversaries falling like lightning ... for his disciples, this is a wink and nod, a hyperlinked to Isaiah 14 as is the custom for Jewish teachers. It’s meant to convey a whole set of ideas from the passage quoted. Picture yourself being one of the disciples and your teachers says this and all of a sudden you recall the entire premise and thoughts conveyed in Isaiah 14.\nTake a deeper look at Isaiah 14, who is the you that has fallen from heaven? It could metaphorically be both the king and the principality set over his land - think Tower of Babylon. However, there is no doubt the king is the one being spoken.\nThere is a &quot;star&quot; referenced in Revelation 9 as falling from Heaven to earth after the fifth trumpet. And a THIRD of mankind is killed by three plagues.\n\nWas this trumpet sounded already in Isaiah 14? If so, then they could be the same being. If not, then they are not.\nDid Revelation 9 happen before, during, or after Revelation 12? Isaiah 14? Zechariah 3?\nThere is/was a war in heaven and the dragon's tail sweeps away a third of the stars of heaven down to earth. - indicating multiple stars fell from heaven to earth. (Rev 12)\n\nAnd the great Dragon, that NACHASH HaKadmoni (Ancient Serpent) was thrown down, the one being called the Malshin (Informer, Accuser/Devil) and Hasatan (Accuser, Adversary/Satan), the one deceiving the whole inhabited world. He was thrown to ha’aretz (the earth) and the malachim of him were thrown down with him.\n\nthis is “the one” deceiving the whole inhabited world - the main adversary. He being called Malshin/devil and hasatan/satan - his name is not Satan, he is the main adversary/satan. He can not be in multiple places at once. And he is not all knowing. He’s the general of the oppositional army.\nalso indicating multiple adversaries/hasatan were thrown to earth - we wrestle against multiple satans, spiritual powers and principalities\nthis malshin and hasatan is bound in Revelation 20.\n\nIs Rev 12 a past, present, or future event? Is this Ancient Serpent the same one called the Great Dragon in Rev 9?\n\nNo matter the answers, it is very clear in Biblical context, there is not one being named “Satan,” especially if you get back to the original languages.",

This underscores the birthright’s communal and spiritual weight.\nHonor and Shame: Despising or losing the birthright (e.g., Esau, Reuben) brought shame, as it signaled disregard for God’s order or moral failure.

Love God and Love Your Neighbors. Christianity teaches we are no longer under the laws but under the blood. Some how that has translated to we don’t have to keep the laws of the Old Testament, which typically is tangled up in the Jewish laws. The Christian’s Laws are also man made because they went to the other side of the road. Theirs is Jesus MINUS the Torah laws. They said we don’t have to know the laws of the Torah, like keeping the Sabbath day.\n- Jesus taught the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Torah</a> (part of the Jewish teaching) PLUS the Kingdom of Heaven is near (part of Christianity’s teaching). Jesus is the FULFILLMENT of everything in the Torah. He has taken the place of the Tabernacle, the High Priest, and the Sacrificial Lamb. He did not take the place of YHWH/God’s law.

The sacrifices became meaningless to them and God could not bear it any more.\nGod gave his Son, Jesus to take the place of the sacrifices. Jesus, was The Anointed One who serves as the unblemished, Passover Lamb.\nJesus and his followers were observing the appointed time of Passover when he took the cup and offered it as his blood, to be poured out for forgiveness of lawlessness (sins) for whoever put their faith in him and obeyed.\nFollowing the Passover Meal, Jesus was arrested, tried, and crucified. He offered himself up as the once for all unblemished, sacrifice for lawlessness (sin).\nHe was sacrificed on Passover at the very same time all the other Passover Lambs were being sacrificed in the Temple.\nGod will again, Passover on Judgement day, whoever has faith, brings the blood of the Passover Lamb (Jesus), and obeys.\nRevelation 12:11: They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives even in the face of death.\nConnections\n\nTags",

		"content": "Define\n\nKiyyor (כִּיּוֹר): The word &quot;kiyyor&quot; refers to a basin or laver, a wide, shallow vessel used for holding water. In the Tabernacle, it’s specifically the bronze container for ritual washing by the priests (<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exod-30:18-21</a> <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exod-30#v19</a> <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exod-30#v20</a> <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exod-30#v21</a>). The Bible doesn’t define &quot;kiyyor&quot; explicitly, but its function is clear: it holds water for purification before entering the Tabernacle or offering sacrifices (Exodus 30:19-20, &quot;for washing... so that they may not die&quot;). <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wash</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/bronze/\">Bronze</a> Nechoshet (נְחֹשֶׁת): This term denotes the material of the laver and its base, translated as &quot;bronze&quot; or &quot;copper&quot; in English. In the Bible, nechumet is used for various Tabernacle items (e.g., altar in <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exod-27:2</a>), indicating a durable, workable metal. The laver’s bronze came from mirrors (<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exod-38:8</a>), but no further etymological detail is provided.\nKen (כֵּן): Refers to the stand or foundation of the laver, also made of bronze. The Bible doesn’t describe its shape or construction but indicates it supports the laver (<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exod-30:18</a>). The term &quot;ken&quot; implies a pedestal or footing to hold the basin steady for use.\nRachats (רָחַץ): This verb describes the laver’s purpose: the priests washed their hands and feet to cleanse themselves ritually (Exodus 30:19, &quot;Aaron and his sons shall wash&quot;). The action is tied to purification to avoid death when approaching God’s presence (Exodus 30:20-21).\n\nRelated words\n\nAdditional Info\nThe Laver\nGod gave the Bronze Laver in the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/dwelling-places/tabernacle/tabernacle/\">Tabernacle</a> to wash clean their hands and feet.\n\nThis washing was not merely physical but symbolized spiritual cleansing, as the priests needed to be pure to approach God’s presence.\nBeing in right relationship and <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/clean/\">Clean</a> //<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">righteous</a> //, they were now prepared to enter into the Holy Place <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Set Apart Place</a>.\n- <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/righteousness/\">Righteousness</a> is described as a state of being “clean” before God, free from sin’s defilement, which the laver facilitated in the priestly service.\nThere was a veil <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Veil</a> between the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Outer Court</a>s and the Holy Place, only a <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Priest</a> could pass through into the Holy Place.\nThe bronze laver was made from the mirrors of the women serving at the entrance to the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Tent of Meeting</a> (<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exod-38:8</a>).

However, the laver’s precise placement between the altar of burnt offering <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/dwelling-places/tabernacle/outer-court/bronze-altar/\">Bronze Altar</a> and the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Tent of Meeting</a> is unique compared to these setups.

The Feast of Unleavened Bread involves removing leaven, often interpreted as a symbol of sin or corruption. <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exod-12:15</a> mandates removing leaven, suggesting a communal purification to honor God’s deliverance. While both emphasize purity, the laver’s role is priestly and ritual, while the feast’s is communal and symbolic, tied to the exodus event.\nHowever, the Bible, does not make a direct connection between the bronze laver and the Feast of Unleavened Bread.\nGod provided a way.\nBefore <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/beings/jesus/\">Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Jesus</a> one came preparing a way, he was called John the Baptizer.\nJohn called people to an immersion in the river as a baptism of repentance from sin, marking a turning away from <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/lawlessness/\">Lawlessness</a> (<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/sin/\">Sin</a>). This is referred to as John's Baptism.\nAt the Passover Meal, Jesus, as the Bread of Life, offered the unleavened bread as his body, in memory of himself.\nThe bread representing dying to lawlessness (sin). Jesus was buried on the Feast of Unleavened Bread.\nThey had always eaten the unleavened bread at the Passover Meal, but Jesus changed why, he said to eat it at the Passover Meal in remembrance of him.\nAt his death, the veil between the Outer Courts and the Holy Place was torn from top to bottom, into two pieces, he had prepared the way for whoever into the Holy Place.\nGod provided those who eat of the Bread of Life (Jesus), a way to live forever, free from leaven (sin).\nHe sacrificed his fleshly body and died to sin, once and for all.

No foreigner may eat it, 44 but every man’s servant that is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat it. 45 Nor should a visitor or hired servant eat it. 46 It is to be eaten inside a single house. You are not to carry the meat out of the house, nor are you to break any of its bones. [a] 47 All the congregation of Israel must keep it. 48 But if an outsider dwells with you, who would keep the Passover for Adonai, all his males must be circumcised. Then let him draw near and keep it**. He** will be like one who is nativ e to the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat from it. 49 The same Torah applies to the native as well as the outsider who dwells among you.”\nE xodus 20:8 -11\n8 “ Remember Yom Shabbat, to keep it holy. 9 You are to work six days, and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a Shabbat to Adonai your God. In it you shall not do any work —not you, nor your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, your cattle, nor the outsider that is within your gates. 11 For in six days Adonai made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Thus Adonai blessed Yom Shabbat, and made it holy.\nL eviticus 16:28-30 - Yom Kippur\n2 9 “It is to be a statute to you forever, that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you are to afflict your souls, and do no kind of work — both the native-born and the outsider dwelling among you. 30 For on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you. From all your sins you will be clean before Adonai.\nL eviticus 17:14-16 - Eating Blood\n1 4 For the life of every creature, its blood is in its life. Therefore I said to Bnei-Yisrael: You are not to eat the blood of any kind of creature, for the life of every creature is its blood. Whoever eats it is to be cut off. 15 “Everyone who eats what dies naturally or is torn by animals —whether he is native-born or a foreigner —is to wash his clothes and bathe himself in water. He will be unclean until the evening, then he will be clean. 16 But if he does not wash them or bathe his body, then he will bear his iniquity.”\nL eviticus 18:25-27\n2 5 The land has become defiled, so I will punish its iniquity, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants. 26 You, however, are to keep My statutes and My ordinances, and do none of these abominations, neither the native-born, nor the outsider dwelling among you. 27 “For all these abominations were done by the men of the land who were before you, and the land became defiled.\nLeviticus 19:33-35\n33 “If an outsider dwells with you in your land, you should do him no wrong. 34 The outsider dwelling among you shall be to you as the native-born among you. You should love him as yourself—for you dwelled as outsiders in the land of Egypt. I am Adonai your God.\nLeviticus 24:15-17\n15 “Then you will speak to Bnei-Yisrael, saying: Whoever curses his God will bear his sin. 16 Whoever blasphemes the Name of Adonai must surely be put to death. The whole congregation must stone him. The outsider as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, is to be put to death.\nLeviticus 24:21-23\n21 “Whoever kills an animal is to make restitution, but the one who kills a man is to be put to death. 22 You are to have one standard of justice for the outsider as well as the native-born, for I am Adonai your God.”\nNumbers 9:13-15\n13 “But the person who is clean and not away on a journey, yet neglects to celebrate Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people because that person did not present Adonai’s offering at the appointed time. That man will bear his sin. 14 “If an outsider living among you would celebrate Passover to Adonai according to the requirement, so he should do. There will be for you the same regulation for the outsider and the native of the land.’”\nNumbers 15:28-30\n28 The kohen is to make atonement before Adonai for that person who erred by sinning without intent, and he is to be forgiven when atonement has been made for him. 29 Whether a native-born of Bnei-Yisrael or an outsider living among them, one Torah applies to you for the one sinning unintentionally. 30 “But the person who sins defiantly, whether native or outsider, reviles Adonai and that person is to be cut off from his people.\nNumbers 15:29-31\n29 Whether a native-born of Bnei-Yisrael or an outsider living among them, one Torah applies to you for the one sinning unintentionally. 30 “But the person who sins defiantly, whether native or outsider, reviles Adonai and that person is to be cut off from his people. 31 Because he has despised the word of Adonai and has broken His commandment, that person will certainly be cut off—his guilt will remain on him.”\nDeuteronomy 5:12-15\n12 ‘Observe Yom Shabbat to keep it holy, as Adonai your God commanded you. 13 Six days you are to labor and do all your work, 14 but the seventh day is a Shabbat to Adonai your God. In it you are not to do any work—not you or your son or your daughter, or your slave or your maid, or your ox, your donkey or any of your livestock or the outsider within your gates, so that your slave and your maid may rest as you do. 15 You must remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Adonai your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore Adonai your God commanded you to keep Yom Shabbat.\nJoshua 8:32-34\n32 There on the stones he wrote a copy of the Torah of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of Bnei-Yisrael. 33 Then all Israel, with their elders and officials, and their judges, were standing on both sides of the ark facing the Levitical kohanim carrying the ark of the covenant of Adonai— the outsider as well as the native-born. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal—just as Moses the servant of Adonai had commanded before—in order to bless the people of Israel.\nEzekiel 47:21-23\n21 You are to divide this land for yourselves to the tribes of Israel. 22 So you are to divide it by lot for an inheritance for you and for the outsiders who dwell among you, whoever bears children among you. They will be to you like the native-born of Bnei-Yisrael; they will be allotted an inheritance along with you among the tribes of Israel. 23 In whatever tribe the outsider lives, there you will give him his inheritance.” It is a declaration of Adonai.\nIsaiah 56 Thus says Adonai:\n“Preserve justice, do righteousness. For My salvation is about to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.2 Blessed is the one who does this, the son of man who takes hold of it, who keeps from profaning Shabbat, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.\n3 Do not let a son of a foreigner who has joined himself to Adonai[a] say, ‘Adonai will surely exclude me from His people.”\n6 Also the foreigners who join themselves to Adonai, to minister to Him, and to love the Name of Adonai, and to be His servants—\nall who keep from profaning Shabbat, and hold fast to My covenant—7 these I will bring to My holy mountain, and let them rejoice in My House of Prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar. For My House will be called a House of Prayer for all nations.”[c]",

		"content": "Nasa\nIn Exodus 34:7, God “bears” (nasa) sin, meaning bearing the death penalty through Yeshua’s sacrifice, forgiving iniquity (avon), rebellion (pesha), and sin (hatta’ah). Nasa is always translated as forgives but the word means bear. Pesha\nIts primary sense is &quot;to carry,&quot; or &quot;to bear.&quot; In ancient Hebrew thought, nasa is rooted in physical imagery—lifting or carrying something heavy.\nIn Hebrew culture, sin (avon, chet, or pesha) was often understood as a tangible weight or defilement that disrupted harmony with God or others. Nasa implies the unloading a heavy load from the guilty party.\nIn Hebrew culture, nasa in relation to forgiveness or bearing burdens often describes God lifting away sin or an individual carrying the weight of guilt or responsibility. When applied to a messianic figure, nasa suggests a role where the anointed one might bear or remove a burden (e.g., sin, suffering, or oppression) on behalf of the people, facilitating restoration of the covenant relationship with God or communal harmony (shalom).\nGod’s power and holiness allow Him to remove the sin without being affected by it.\nHowever, human-to-human forgiveness in Hebrew culture is less frequently described with nasa. When it occurs, the focus is on releasing the offender from the weight of their wrong, not on the forgiver retaining the burden. The act of lifting implies setting the matter aside to restore communal harmony (shalom).\nLeviticus 19:17-18",

Keeping the Sabbath honors God’s name by affirming His identity as the sanctifier and creator (Exodus 20:11 ties the Sabbath to God’s creation, where His name as Creator is central).\nEzekiel 20:12, 20:\nHebrew (Ezekiel 20:12): וְגַם אֶת־שַׁבְּתוֹתַי נָתַתִּי לָהֶם לִהְיוֹת לְאוֹת בֵּינִי וּבֵינֵיהֶם לָדַעַת כִּי אֲנִי יְהוָה מְקַדְּשָׁם\nTranslation: &quot;Also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am YHWH who sanctifies them.&quot;\nHebrew (Ezekiel 20:20): וְאֶת־שַׁבְּתוֹתַי קַדְּשׁוּ וְהָיוּ לְאוֹת בֵּינִי וּבֵינֵיכֶם לָדַעַת כִּי אֲנִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵיכֶם\nTranslation: &quot;Hallow My Sabbaths, and they will be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am YHWH your God.&quot;\nContext: Here, keeping the Sabbath is directly linked to knowing and honoring God as YHWH. Profaning the Sabbath (as Israel did, Ezekiel 20:13, 16) dishonors God’s name by rejecting the sign that points to His identity and authority. Conversely, keeping the Sabbath upholds God’s name by affirming His role as the covenant God.\nEzekiel 22:8, 26:\nHebrew (Ezekiel 22:8): קָדָשַׁי בָּזִית וְאֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַי חִלַּלְתְּ\nTranslation: &quot;You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths.&quot;\nHebrew (Ezekiel 22:26): כֹּהֲנֶיהָ חָמְסוּ תוֹרָתִי וַיְחַלְּלוּ קָדָשַׁי ... וְאֶת־שַׁבְּתוֹתַי חִלְּלוּ\nTranslation: &quot;Her priests have done violence to My law and profaned My holy things … and they have profaned My Sabbaths.&quot;\nContext: Profaning the Sabbath is part of a broader pattern of dishonoring God, which includes profaning His holy things. While God’s name isn’t explicitly mentioned, Ezekiel 36:20-23 (elsewhere in the same book) connects Israel’s actions to profaning God’s name among the nations:\nHebrew (Ezekiel 36:20): וַיְחַלְּלוּ אֶת־שֵׁם קָדְשִׁי\nTranslation: &quot;They profaned My holy name.&quot;\nThis suggests that failing to keep the Sabbath, a sign of the covenant, indirectly profanes God’s name by misrepresenting His holiness to the nations.\nIsaiah 1:13-14:\nHebrew (Isaiah 1:13): לֹא אוּכַל אָוֶן וַעֲצָרָה קְטֹרֶת תּוֹעֵבָה הִיא לִי חֹדֶשׁ וְשַׁבָּת קְרֹא מִקְרָא\nTranslation: &quot;I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly; your new moons and your Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies—it is an abomination to Me.&quot;\nContext: God rejects Israel’s hypocritical Sabbath observances because they are paired with iniquity. While God’s name isn’t mentioned directly, the broader context of Isaiah (e.g., Isaiah 48:1, where Israel invokes God’s name but not in truth or righteousness) suggests that such hypocrisy dishonors God’s name. Keeping the Sabbath insincerely fails to reflect the holiness of God’s name.\nNehemiah 9:14:\nHebrew: וְאֶת־שַׁבָּת קָדְשְׁךָ הוֹדַעְתָּ לָהֶם וּמִצְוֹת וְחֻקִּים וְתוֹרָה צִוִּיתָ לָהֶם בְּיַד מֹשֶׁה עַבְדֶּךָ\nTranslation: &quot;You made known to them Your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, statutes, and a law by the hand of Moses Your servant.&quot;\nContext: In this prayer, the Levites recount God’s acts, including giving the Sabbath. Earlier in the chapter (Nehemiah 9:6-7), they praise God’s name (YHWH) as the Creator, linking the Sabbath (a sign of creation) to the honor of His name.\nThe Bible establishes a relationship between keeping the Sabbath and honoring God’s name in several ways:\n\nCovenantal Framework (Ten Commandments): In Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, the commands to honor God’s name and keep the Sabbath are part of the same covenant, emphasizing reverence for God in both speech and time.\nSabbath as a Sign (Exodus 31, Ezekiel 20): The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant, pointing to God as YHWH who sanctifies. Keeping the Sabbath honors His name by affirming His identity; profaning it dishonors His name by rejecting that sign.\nHoliness and Hypocrisy (Isaiah 1, Ezekiel 22): Failing to keep the Sabbath with sincerity (Isaiah 1:13) or profaning it (Ezekiel 22:8) indirectly profanes God’s name, as it misrepresents His holiness to the nations (Ezekiel 36:20-23).\nThematic Link of Holiness: Both the Sabbath and God’s name are tied to God’s holiness. Keeping the Sabbath reflects the sanctity of God’s name as Creator and Redeemer, while misusing His name or neglecting the Sabbath undermines that sanctity.\n\nHeiser, Michael S.. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/sources/heiser-michael-s/the-unseen-realm/\">The Unseen Realm</a>: Recovering the Supernatural Worldview of the Bible. Lexham Press. Kindle Edition.\n\nThe biblical passages we’ve seen above show that there is biblical precedent for the practice. In other passages, “the Name” functions as a substitute word for Yahweh. In several the Name is personified—the Name is a person. Isaiah 30 :27–28 is quite striking in this regard: The Name is clearly cast as an entity, as Yahweh himself, in this text.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Psalm-20 :1</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Psalm-20 #v2</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Psalm-20 #v3</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Psalm-20 #v4</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Psalm-20 #v5</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Psalm-20 #v6</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">-7</a>, psalm is that trusting in the Name means trusting in Yahweh himself—he is the Name.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Deut-12</a>",

		"content": "Basic Meaning:\nThe term minchah (מִנְחָה) originally means &quot;gift&quot; or &quot;tribute&quot; in Hebrew, often implying something offered to honor or appease. In the context of Leviticus 2, it specifically refers to a &quot;grain offering&quot; or &quot;meal offering,&quot; a non-animal sacrifice made to God.\nContext in Leviticus 2: The minchah is a voluntary offering of grain (typically fine flour), often mixed with oil and frankincense, and sometimes baked or cooked (e.g., as loaves or cakes). It symbolizes gratitude, devotion, or acknowledgment of God's provision. A portion is burned on the altar, and the rest is given to the priests.\nTheological Significance: It represents the worshiper's dedication of their labor and sustenance to God, emphasizing dependence on Him for daily provision.\nGreek Equivalent of Minchah\nIn the Septuagint (LXX), the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Hebrew word minchah is most commonly translated as θυσία (thysia) or δῶρον (dōron), depending on the context:\nθυσία (thysia): Primarily used for minchah in the sense of a sacrificial offering, especially the grain offering in Leviticus and Numbers. It generally means &quot;sacrifice&quot; or &quot;offering&quot; and is applied to both animal and non-animal sacrifices in the LXX.\nδῶρον (dōron): Used for minchah when it refers to a &quot;gift&quot; or &quot;tribute,&quot; such as offerings to kings or non-sacrificial gifts (e.g., Genesis 32:13, 43:11). It means &quot;gift&quot; or &quot;present.&quot;\nOther terms like προσφορά (prosphora, &quot;offering&quot;) are occasionally used in specific contexts, particularly for ritual offerings, but less frequently for minchah.\n“The purpose of the Grain Offering is not atonement, but worship, acknowledgment of God’s divine provision of the needs of the Israelite for life itself. The Grain Offering praised God for His abundant supply of the “daily bread” of the Israelite. But while men do not contribute to their redemption, they do participate in the growing of the crops by which God sustains their life. Thus, the human element is present in the Grain Offering in a way that it is not in the Burnt Offering.

He shall return it to him to whom it belongs in the day of his being found guilty. 6 He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh: a ram without defect from the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest. 7 The priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will be forgiven concerning whatever he does to become guilty.”\nLeviticus 7:1-2 (WEB): &quot;This is the law of the trespass offering. It is most holy. In the place where they kill the burnt offering, he shall kill the trespass offering; and its blood he shall sprinkle around on the altar.&quot;\nNumbers 15:30–31 states, “But the person who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native or a sojourner, reviles the Lord, and that person shall be cut off from among his people. Because he has despised the word of the Lord and has broken his commandment, that person shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.”\n\nDetails: The Asham addresses specific offenses, often requiring restitution (e.g., Leviticus 5:16). A ram is typically offered, and it is considered “most holy.”\n\nMeaning: A guilt or reparation offering, often linked to restitution for specific wrongs, such as violating sacred things or unintentional sins requiring compensation.\nContext: Used in cases requiring reparative action (e.g., <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05:6</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v7</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v8</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v9</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v10</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v11</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v12</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v13</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v14</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v15</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v16</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v17</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Lev-05#v18</a><a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">-19</a>).\nKey Points:\n\nRequired for specific sins, like misusing holy things or wronging others, often with restitution.\nTypically a ram or equivalent value; includes blood and burning rituals.\nFocuses on making amends, both to God and affected parties.\nClosely related to sin offering but emphasizes compensation.\n\nExample: Leviticus 5:15 – “He shall bring his guilt offering (asham) to the Lord.”\n\nYeshua/Jesus under the renewed covenant became a guilt offering.\n\nIsaiah 53:10 Yet it pleased Adonai to bruise Him. He caused Him to suffer. If He makes His soul a guilt offering, He will see His offspring, He will prolong His days, and the will of Adonai will succeed by His hand.\n1 Peter 2:23-24 When He was abused, He did not return the abuse. While suffering, He made no threats. Instead, He kept entrusting Himself to the One who judges righteously. 24 He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that we, removed from sins, might live for righteousness. “By His wounds you were healed.” (TLV)\n1 John 1:5-10 Now this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you—that God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we say we have fellowship with Him and keep walking in the darkness, we are lying and do not practice the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of His Son Yeshua purifies us from all sin. 8 If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. (TLV)\nEphesians 5:1-3 Therefore be imitators of God, as dearly loved children; 2 and walk in love, just as Messiah also loved us[a] and gave Himself up for us as an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant aroma. 3 But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed—don’t even let these be mentioned among you, as is proper for kedoshim. (TLV)\nHebrew 10:12, 26-29 But on the other hand, when this One offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God— ... 26 For if we keep on sinning willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but only a terrifying expectation of judgment and a fury of fire about to devour the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the Torah of Moses dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 29 How much more severe do you think the punishment will be for the one who has trampled Ben-Elohim underfoot, and has regarded as unholy the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?

Restoration of relationship with God.\nIt is offered to\n\nexpress thanksgiving (confession),\n\nwhen the worshipper sought God for deliverance from his enemies or for healing from sickness\nSince some unknown sin was often seen as the cause for oppression from an enemy or for becoming ill, it was logical that the confession of sin was necessary if he thought that was the reason for his predicament. Now it goes without saying that these sins would have been of the unintentional variety, because they were unknown to the worshipper.\nthis was more about seeking God’s mercy upon the sinful CONDITION of the worshipper rather than for acts of misbehavior. Acts of misbehavior were dealt with by means of other kinds of sacrifices\n\nfulfill a vow,\n\nIt was typical in that day to make a vow to God that if He helped you out of some kind of problem, or would show His mercy to you for a special need, you would pledge to do something for God in return. When that pledge, that vow, to God was fulfilled it would be capped off with ceremony that included a Peace Offering.\nThis is the one offered by Paul in Acts\n\nor as a freewill offering\nthe worshipper was not seeking something from God; rather, this was simply a spontaneous expression of gratitude to Yehoveh\n\nThe animal (cattle, sheep, or goat, male or female) must be without blemish.

And whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca’ shall be subject to the council[d]; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be subject to fiery Gehenna. 23 “Therefore if you are presenting your offering upon the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your offering there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering. 25 “Make friends quickly with your opponent while you are with him on the way.

It says this: (this is God speaking) “If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and all that is in it is mine. Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?” What we should take from this Psalm is that 1) the pagan mindset of Hebrews even in the era of David (300 years after Moses) at times must have actually viewed Yehoveh as eating food (or God would not have scolded the Hebrews about it).\nTherefore the ultimate meaning of His instructions, such as here in Leviticus, whereby it speaks of the smoke being a lovely fragrance to God’s nostrils, is not physical, but spiritual in it’s meaning. God does NOT have nostrils, nor does He “smell” the smoke the way we humans think of it.",

		"content": "The term &quot;zevach&quot; (זֶבַח) in the Orthodox Jewish Bible ( Tritestament refers to a sacrifice or offering, typically an animal sacrifice, and is a significant concept in Jewish scripture. Below is a list of verses from the Orthodox Jewish Bible (OJB) that explicitly use the word &quot;zevach&quot; (or its variants, such as &quot;zevachim&quot;). The list is compiled based on a search of the OJB text, focusing on instances where &quot;zevach&quot; appears in the Hebrew or is transliterated in the English translation. The OJB is an English translation that incorporates Yiddish and Hasidic cultural expressions, and it follows the traditional Jewish order of the Tanakh.\nThe list below includes all relevant verses where &quot;zevach&quot; or its plural form &quot;zevachim&quot; is used, primarily in the context of ritual sacrifices or offerings. Note that some verses may use related terms or imply the concept without directly using &quot;zevach,&quot; the list is limited to explicit mentions to ensure accuracy. The OJB retains Hebrew terms like &quot;zevach&quot; in transliteration, making it easier to identify.\nScriptures Containing &quot;Zevach&quot; in the Orthodox Jewish Bible\nThe term &quot;zevach&quot; generally denotes a sacrificial offering, often an animal slaughtered and presented to God as part of worship, atonement, or covenantal rituals. The contexts in which &quot;zevach&quot; appears in the listed verses reflect various aspects of ancient Israelite religious life, categorized below by book and theme:\nBereshis (Genesis)\n\nGenesis 31:54: Ya’akov (Jacob) offers a &quot;zevach&quot; on a mountain after reconciling with Lavan (Laban). This sacrifice accompanies a covenant meal shared with his kin, symbolizing peace and agreement. The context highlights the use of &quot;zevach&quot; in sealing covenants through communal eating, a practice that reinforces social and spiritual bonds.\nGenesis 46:1: Yisroel (Jacob) offers &quot;zevachim&quot; at Be’er-Sheva before journeying to Egypt. This act is a form of worship and gratitude to God, reflecting a personal and familial devotion as he seeks divine guidance for his relocation.\n\nShemos (Exodus)\n\nExodus 3:18, 5:3: The Israelites, led by Moshe (Moses), request permission from Pharaoh to travel into the wilderness to offer &quot;zevach&quot; to Hashem (God). These verses frame the sacrifice as a central act of worship, distinguishing the Israelites’ religious identity from Egyptian practices and emphasizing their covenantal obligation to serve God.\nExodus 8:24: This verse, while containing &quot;zevach&quot; in the Hebrew text, refers to the purpose of the Israelites’ departure from Egypt to perform sacrifices, reinforcing the idea that sacrifices are a divine command to maintain their distinct relationship with God.\nExodus 10:25: Moshe insists that Pharaoh provide animals for &quot;zevachim and olot&quot; (sacrifices and burnt offerings), underscoring the necessity of proper sacrificial materials to fulfill religious obligations during the Exodus narrative.\nExodus 12:27: The &quot;zevach of Hashem’s Pesach&quot; refers to the Passover lamb, a foundational ritual commemorating the liberation from Egypt. The sacrifice is both a protective act (sparing the Israelites during the tenth plague) and a communal meal, integrating worship with collective memory.\nExodus 13:15: The sacrifice of firstborn animals is linked to the redemption of human firstborns, recalling the Passover event. &quot;Zevach&quot; here connects to the broader theme of dedicating the firstfruits to God as an act of gratitude and obedience.\nExodus 23:18, 34:25: These verses provide laws prohibiting offering the blood of a &quot;zevach&quot; with leaven (chametz) or allowing its fat to remain until morning. These regulations ensure the purity and timeliness of sacrifices, reflecting the meticulous care required in worship.\nExodus 34:15: This verse warns against participating in the &quot;zevach&quot; of foreign gods, highlighting the exclusivity of Israelite worship and the danger of idolatry, a recurring concern in the Torah.\n\nVayikra (Leviticus)\nThe book of Leviticus, which details the sacrificial system, uses &quot;zevach&quot; extensively, particularly in the context of the zevach shelamim (peace offering) and zevach todah (thanksgiving offering):\n\nLeviticus 1:5: Describes the slaughter of a bull as part of a sacrificial ritual, with &quot;zevach&quot; implied in the Hebrew text as the act of offering at the altar, emphasizing the priestly role in mediating between the people and God.\nLeviticus 3:1, 3:3, 3:6, 3:9, 7:11, 7:12, 7:13, 7:15, 7:16, 7:17, 7:18: These verses outline the procedures for the zevach shelamim, a voluntary offering expressing gratitude, communion, or fulfillment of vows. The offering involves presenting an unblemished animal (cattle or flock), burning specific portions (fat) as an offering to God, and eating the remaining meat within a prescribed time (same day for thanksgiving offerings, up to two days for vow or freewill offerings). The term &quot;zevach&quot; here underscores a communal meal shared with God, reinforcing the covenantal relationship. The prohibition against eating the meat on the third day (Leviticus 7:18) ensures ritual purity, as such meat becomes &quot;piggul&quot; (unclean).\n\nShoftim (Judges)\n\nJudges 8:12: While this verse in the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) mentions Zevach as a proper name (a Midianite king), the Hebrew text does not use &quot;zevach&quot; as a sacrifice here. It is included in the search results due to the name but is not relevant to the sacrificial context.\n\nHoshea (Hosea)\n\nHosea 6:6: &quot;For I desired chesed, and not zevach; and the da’as Elohim more than olot (burnt offerings).&quot; This verse critiques the overemphasis on ritual sacrifices, prioritizing loving-kindness (chesed) and knowledge of God. It reflects a prophetic call to internalize the values behind sacrifices rather than rely solely on external rituals.\n\nMishlei (Proverbs)\n\nProverbs 21:27: &quot;The zevach of the resha’im is to’evah (detestable, abomination); how much more, when he bringeth it with zimmah (evil intent).&quot; This verse condemns sacrifices offered by the wicked, especially with malicious intent, highlighting that the moral state of the offerer affects the acceptability of the sacrifice.\n\nReflection of Religious Practices in Ancient Israel\nThe term &quot;zevach&quot; in these scriptures reveals several key aspects of ancient Israelite religious practices:\n\nCovenantal Relationship with God: The &quot;zevach&quot; is often a communal act, such as the Passover lamb (Exodus 12:27) or peace offerings (Leviticus 3, 7), where part of the sacrifice is burned for God and part is eaten by the community. This shared meal symbolizes communion with God and reinforces the covenant between Israel and Hashem, as seen in Genesis 31:54 and Leviticus 7:13-15. The act of eating together strengthens communal and spiritual bonds.\nRitual Purity and Precision: The detailed regulations in Leviticus (e.g., Leviticus 3:1-9, 7:11-18) and Exodus (e.g., Exodus 23:18, 34:25) emphasize the need for unblemished animals, specific portions to be offered, and time limits for consumption. These rules reflect the holiness of the sacrificial act, ensuring that it is performed with reverence and in accordance with divine instructions, as deviations (e.g., eating on the third day, Leviticus 7:18) render the offering unacceptable.\nDistinction from Other Nations: Verses like Exodus 3:18, 5:3, and 34:15 highlight the &quot;zevach&quot; as a marker of Israelite identity, distinguishing their worship from that of surrounding nations. The prohibition against participating in foreign sacrifices (Exodus 34:15) underscores the exclusivity of devotion to Hashem, a central theme in the Torah.\nMoral and Spiritual Dimensions: Prophetic texts like Hosea 6:6 and Proverbs 21:27 emphasize that the efficacy of a &quot;zevach&quot; depends on the offerer’s intent and moral conduct. Sacrifices without genuine faith, love, or righteousness are deemed unacceptable, reflecting a broader theological principle that external rituals must align with internal devotion.\nHistorical and Commemorative Role: The &quot;zevach&quot; in contexts like the Passover (Exodus 12:27) and firstborn offerings (Exodus 13:15) serves as a memorial of God’s deliverance, embedding historical memory into religious practice. These sacrifices connect the Israelites to their foundational narrative of liberation from Egypt.\n\nBroader Significance\nIn ancient Israel, the &quot;zevach&quot; was not merely a ritual but a multifaceted practice that integrated worship, community, covenant renewal, and moral reflection. It was performed in specific settings (e.g., the Tabernacle, later the Temple) and required adherence to strict guidelines to maintain holiness. The term’s usage in the OJB reflects its role in fostering a relationship with God, reinforcing communal identity, and commemorating divine acts, while prophetic critiques remind the people that sacrifices must be accompanied by ethical living.\nNotes\nThe list focuses on verses explicitly using &quot;zevach&quot; or &quot;zevachim&quot; in the OJB text, cross-referenced with the Hebrew Masoretic Text to ensure accuracy. Some verses (e.g., Leviticus 1:5, Exodus 8:24) include &quot;zevach&quot; in the Hebrew but may not transliterate it in the OJB, so they are included conservatively.\nJudges 8:12 is excluded from the final analysis as it refers to a proper name, not a sacrifice.\nThe OJB’s retention of Hebrew terms like &quot;zevach&quot; aids in identifying these instances, though its Messianic perspective includes New Testament references (e.g., Hosea 6:6 citing Matthew 9:13), which are not part of traditional Jewish scripture. This analysis focuses solely on the Tanakh.\nDue to the limitations of accessible OJB texts, some occurrences of &quot;zevach&quot; in other books (e.g., Numbers, Deuteronomy) may exist but were not found in the provided sources. For a complete list, a full-text search of the OJB would be required, which is beyond current capabilities.",

Worshiping Other Gods or Idolatry\n\nScripture reference: Deuteronomy 17:2-5\nScripture text (WEB): &quot;If there is found among you, within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you, a man or woman who does that which is evil in Yahweh your God’s sight in transgressing his covenant, and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the stars of the sky, which I have not commanded, and you are told, and hear of it, then you shall inquire diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is committed in Israel, then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones.&quot;\nPenalty or Consequence: Death by stoning (Deut. 17:5).\nOffering or Ransom: None specified in Deuteronomy. Leviticus 4:27-31 mentions sin offerings for unintentional sins, but idolatry is a deliberate &quot;high-handed&quot; sin, typically unforgivable without repentance (Num. 15:30-31). <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/offering/sins-requiring-death-no-offering/\">Sins Requiring Death - No Offering</a>\nNote: No set elders anymore.\n\n2.

The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.&quot;\nPenalty or Consequence: Death (Deut. 18:20).\nOffering or Ransom: None specified.

This is a deliberate act, so no atonement is implied.\n\n5. Disobedience to Priests or Judges\n\nScripture reference: Deuteronomy 17:8-12\nScripture text (WEB): &quot;If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh your God chooses. You shall come to the priests who are Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days. You shall inquire, and they shall give you the verdict. You shall do according to the verdict which they shall give you from that place which Yahweh chooses. You shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you. According to the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do. You shall not turn away from the sentence which they announce to you, to the right hand, nor to the left. The man who does presumptuously in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die. You shall put away the evil from Israel.&quot;\nPenalty or Consequence: Death for presumptuous disobedience (Deut. 17:12).\nOffering or Ransom: None specified. Presumptuous sins generally exclude atonement (Num. 15:30-31).\n\n6. Adultery\n\nScripture reference: Deuteronomy 22:22\nScripture text (WEB): &quot;If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man who lay with the woman and the woman.

There is in the lady no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter; for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was no one to save her.&quot;\nPenalty or Consequence: Death for the man (Deut. 22:25).\nOffering or Ransom: None specified. The woman is innocent, and no atonement is required for her.

Sexual Relations with a Virgin Not Betrothed\n\nScripture reference: Deuteronomy 22:28-29\nScripture text (WEB): &quot;If a man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, grabs her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady’s father fifty shekels of silver. She shall be his wife, because he has humbled her. He may not put her away all his days.&quot;\nPenalty or Consequence: Payment of 50 shekels of silver and mandatory marriage without divorce (Deut. 22:29).\nOffering or Ransom: The 50 shekels serves as a form of compensation to the father, but no sacrificial atonement is specified.\n\n9.

Described as an &quot;abomination,&quot; implying severe divine disapproval, potentially linked to exclusion from the community (Lev. 18:29 for similar abominations).\nOffering or Ransom: None specified. Atonement for abominations typically requires repentance and possibly a sin offering (Lev. 4:27-31), but not explicit here.\n\nCommands which are to be done and are not does not fit into any offering's definition? Intentionally not doing or doing something which is a do not, does not fit into any offerings definition?\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Sin Offering</a>?: Emphasis on purification from defilement. Unintentional sins against the commandments of God which are not to be done. Primarily those that defile the sinner or the sanctuary requiring purification.\n\n10. Neglecting Firstfruits and Tithes\n\nScripture reference: Deuteronomy 26:12-15\nScripture text (WEB): &quot;When you have finished tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within your gates and be filled.

I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have I forgotten them. I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor given of it for the dead. I have listened to Yahweh my God’s voice. I have done according to all that you have commanded me. Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.'&quot;\nPenalty or Consequence: None explicitly stated, but failure to obey implies forfeiture of divine blessing (Deut. 28:15-68 for general covenant curses).\nOffering or Ransom: The tithe itself is the offering, given to Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows. No additional atonement is specified.\n\n11. Blasphemy (Cursing God’s Name)\n\nScripture reference: Deuteronomy 5:11 (reiterating the Ten Commandments)\nScripture text (WEB): &quot;You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain, for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.&quot;\nPenalty or Consequence: Not held guiltless, implying divine judgment. Leviticus 24:16 specifies death by stoning for blasphemy.\nOffering or Ransom: None specified. Blasphemy is a high-handed sin (Num. 15:30-31), typically without atonement. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/offering/sins-requiring-death-no-offering/\">Sins Requiring Death - No Offering</a>\n\n12. Sabbath Violation\n\nScripture reference: Deuteronomy 5:12-15\nScripture text (WEB): &quot;Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you.

You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm. Therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.&quot;\nPenalty or Consequence: Not specified in Deuteronomy, but Exodus 31:14-15 and Numbers 15:32-36 prescribe death for Sabbath violation.\nOffering or Ransom: None specified.

They shall tell the elders of his city, 'This our son is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.'

A biblical writer would not have presumed that Yahweh could be defeated on any given day by another elohim, or that another elohim (why not any of them?) had the same set of attributes. That is polytheistic thinking. It is not the biblical picture.\nW e can be confident of this conclusion by once again observing what the biblical writers say about Yahweh —and never say about another elohim. The biblical writers speak of Yahweh in ways that telegraph their belief in his uniqueness and incomparability: “Who is like you among the gods [elim], Yahweh?” (Exod 15:11) “ ‘What god [el] is there in the heaven or on the earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty deeds?’ ” (Deut 3:24) “ O Yahweh, God of Israel, there is no god [elohim] like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath” (1 Kgs 8:23). For you, O Yahweh, are most high over all the earth.\nY ou are highly exalted above all gods [elohim] (Psalm 97:9). Biblical writers also assign unique qualities to Yahweh. Yahweh is all-powerful (Jer 32:17, 27; Pss 72:18; 115:3), the sovereign king over the other elohim (Psa 95:3; Dan 4:35; 1 Kgs 22:19), the creator of the other members of his host-council (Psa 148:1 – 5; Neh 9:6; cf. Job 38:7; Deut 4:19–20; 17:3; 29:25–26; 32:17; Jas 1:17) 5 and the lone elohim who deserves worship from the other elohim (Psa 29:1). In fact, Nehemiah 9:6 explicitly declares that Yahweh is unique—there is only one Yahweh (“You alone are Yahweh ”). The biblical use of elohim is not hard to understand once we know that it isn’t about attributes. What all the figures on the list have in common is that they are inhabitants of the spiritual world. In that realm there is hierarchy. For example, Yahweh possesses superior attributes with respect to all elohim. But God’s attributes aren’t what makes him an elohim, since inferior beings are members of that same group. The Old Testament writers understood that Yahweh was an elohim —but no other elohim was Yahweh. He was species-unique among all residents of the spiritual world.\nT he only perfect Being is God. This is why things could, and did, go wrong in Eden. If that was true even in Eden —the place on earth where the council was present—then being in the presence of God is no guarantee that free-will beings will never stray or act out of self-will. Only God is perfect.\nO nly God is perfect.\nM any Bible readers wonder why God would have allowed (much less instructed, as in Gen 46:3 – 4) Israel to go to Egypt. “ Deuteronomy 32 worldview,” where the nations and their gods are pitted against Israel and Yahweh. Israel was in Egypt precisely so that Yahweh could deliver them—thereby conveying this theological message.\nT he Bible tells us the plagues were aimed at Egypt’s gods (Exod 12:12; Num 33:4), the elohim who had been given their authority by Yahweh and who were supposed to govern Egypt on his behalf.\nTHE EXODUS EVENT, THE DELIVERANCE FROM BONDAGE IN EGYPT, WAS THE catalyst for Israel’s transition from a people to a nation.\nDeuteronomy 32:8–9 I mentioned that the number of nations disinherited by Yahweh at the judgment of Babel was seventy.1 The number is telling. Israel’s nearest religious competition, the worship of El, Baal, and Asherah at Ugarit and in Canaan, held that their divine council had seventy sons. When Yahweh disinherited the nations and allotted them to the sons of God, a theological gauntlet was thrown down: Yahweh alone commands the nations and their gods. Other gods serve him.\nConnections\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/gate-of-wisdom/dwelling-places/tabernacle/most-set-apart-place/ark-of-the-testimony/\">Ark of the Testimony</a>\n\nTags",
