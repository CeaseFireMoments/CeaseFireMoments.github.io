# Additional Info
- In the Torah, Yom Kippur is actually written in the plural as Yom Ha-Kippurim. This could be explained in such a way that the plural should be understood as a superlative “full atonement” or “complete purgation.” The plurality functions grammatically to intensify the word. --- 119 Ministries https://119ministries.com/teachings/video-teachings/detail/moedim-yom-kippur/
