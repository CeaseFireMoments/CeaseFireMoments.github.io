According to the Dead Sea Scrolls: Unleavened Bread is a week long festival occurring from Wednesday, Nisan 15 through Tuesday, Nisan 21.

Unleavened bread - when we come out of Egypt, we come with no sin attached to us. 

At the time of Passover we are called to take the leaven out of our homes, leaven represents sin. [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/43 - John/John-02#v13\|John-02:13]] - the Passover was at hand. A time to examine our own temples.

[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/43 - John/John-02#v18\|John-02:18]] Just as Moses built the tabernacle, so Jesus would build the new tabernacle in our hearts.  

In the same way the plagues took place at the time of Exodus, they take place in Jesus
* first water turned to blood - Jesus turned water into wine
* last death of first born, Jesus was the first born

Have you left Egypt/the world in haste? Have you cleaned your temple of the leaven/sin?

## Called into [[Gate of Wisdom/Righteousness\|Righteousness]]: 

As we observe this appointed time of God's, we are to remember God provides for us. We are to clean out all the lawlessness (sin) in our houses. Just as he prepared a way through the wilderness into the promised land for the Israelites, he has prepared a way into righteousness and the Holy Place through his son, Jesus. Jesus has paid the ransom for those have faith in him and obey. On this day we remember his triumphant descent - the original Holy Saturday.

God appointed the festival of Unleavened Bread for whoever in all generations, to remember this is the day whoevers were brought out of bondage.
* Celebrate at the place God chooses.
* This was fulfilled when Jesus was buried.
