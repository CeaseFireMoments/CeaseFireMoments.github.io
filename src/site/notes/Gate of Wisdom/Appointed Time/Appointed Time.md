# Define
- Hebrew: mo‘ed / mo‘adim (מוֹעֵד / מֹעֲדִים) - “appointed time”, “appointed place”, “meeting”
- The divinely fixed sacred times when God “meets” with His people
- typically translated as Appointed feast(s), set feast(s), appointed time(s), solemn assembly
	- It is by the word and the spirit that we experience New Creation blessing in our lives the biblical holidays are not just meant to be mere remembrances. The Hebrew word for a holiday is Chag, it literally comes from the Hebrew word which means Circle. It happens every year it comes around but they are not just meant to be remembrances, they're meant to be reoccurrences. What God did at this time in season he wants to do again in your life today. They're meant to be reoccurrences in the sense they are prophetic, they are for us. When we come into alignment with the times and the seasons, there is a revelation and there is a release of of spiritual truth and blessing into our lives. There is something prophetic about it that we can step into what God did for them he wants to do for us because he is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

# Notes

Appointed times of YHWH/God (Leviticus 23 ):

- Passover  (Pesach)
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Feast of Unleavened Bread\|Feast of Unleavened Bread]]  (Hag HaMatzot)
- First Fruits  (Yom Hibikkurim)
- Festival of Weeks /Pentecost  (Shavuot)
- Feast of Trumpets  (Yom Teruah /Rosh Hashanah)
- Day of Atonement  (Yom Kippur)
- Feast of Tabernacles  (Sukkot)
- Seventh Day Sabbath 

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, These are the appointed feasts of the Lord that you shall proclaim as holy convocations; they are my appointed feasts. Exodus 23  (ESV)

Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” Matthew 28 

Therefore let no one [pagans in Colossae] pass judgment on you [new converts] in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These [appointed feasts/Sabbath day] are a shadow of the things to come [2nd coming of Christ], but the substance  [reality] belongs to Christ.
Colossians 2  

“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.” Revelation 1 

These are traditionally seen as “Jewish” holidays, but they are not. These are appointed days by God, they are HIS Holy Days. He said to remember them forever, generation to generation.

These Holy Days are symbolic and a shadowing of the first and second coming of the Messiah.

‘Holy convocation’ is the idea of a dress rehearsal. God’s Holy Days were meant as a dress rehearsal for what is to come. It prepared the Israelites for the Messiah’s first coming. It prepares those who follow Jesus for the Messiah’s second coming.

 - The Great Banquet feast  ... Luke 14 

Just before Exodus 32  Yah/God laid out all the feasts which were to be celebrated, they were His appointed times. He also gave them the command to not make idols.

In Exodus 32 we see the people asking for idols to be made. Aaron builds an altar before the idol and says. "A festival to YHWH tomorrow." Did you see that? Aaron made up his own festival to honor and celebrate YHWH - not just an god or gods. 

They decided they knew a good way to celebrate YHWH. To recognize his bringing them out of bondage. And they did it in a way that was known to them by using the traditions of the Egyptians. 

And what was God's reaction to the people doing things the way they wanted to to do them instead of the ways he laid out for them?

Amos 5 :18--
Malachi 2  -- 

# Title: 3:22 Min Bible Studies: Torah Appointed Times

## Description:
Before diving into a deep study on Matthew 5, we are taking some time to read through what would have been considered Law or Torah to Jesus as he was speaking. We aren't trying to figure out if we SHOULD keep them, this is about COULD we? Today we are looking at Appointed Times
