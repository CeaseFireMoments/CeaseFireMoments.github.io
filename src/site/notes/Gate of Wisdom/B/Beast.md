# Additional Info
- Two main “beasts” appear in Revelation 13:  
  1. The beast from the sea (Rev 13:1–10) – the primary political/military Antichrist figure with seven heads, ten horns, and blasphemous names.  
  2. The beast from the earth / false prophet (Rev 13:11–18) – exercises the first beast’s authority, enforces the mark, and performs signs.  
- The sea-beast is the one explicitly called “the beast” throughout the rest of Revelation (Rev 16:13; 17:3–17; 19:19–20; 20:10) and is thrown alive into the lake of fire at Christ’s return (Rev 19:20).
