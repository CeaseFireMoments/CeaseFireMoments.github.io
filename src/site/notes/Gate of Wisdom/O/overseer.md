# Define
- Hebrew: There is no direct Hebrew equivalent in the Old Testament for episkopos (ἐπίσκοπος) 
	- The NT overseer combines OT elder authority, judge-like governance, officer-style supervision, and shepherd responsibility. So the closest OT equivalent in role is:
		- Elder (zaqen) for structure
		- Judge (shofet) for authority
		- Officer (paqîd) for oversight. The verbal root pāqad (פָּקַד) – meaning "to visit, oversee, appoint, care for" – is sometimes rendered expressing the function of oversight

- Greek: episkopos (ἐπίσκοπος)
	- The word itself is a noun meaning “overseer” or “guardian,” describing the function of watching over, shepherding, and caring for the flock of YHWH.
	- In the New Testament era, the roles of presbyteros and episkopos describe the same men and their shepherding oversight, with presbyteros linking directly back to the Old Testament zaqen (זָקֵן), while episkopos emphasizes the function of that elder role without a precise Old Testament titular parallel.
