# Notes
- Scripture consistently shows the adversary can incite, tempt, or enter humans to influence or control actions—always under YHWH’s sovereign boundary.
- Job and Zechariah depict haśśāṭān as a role (heavenly prosecutor/tester) played by an angelic being in YHWH's service, not a named personal entity opposing God. This contrasts with NT development into a singular fallen adversary (e.g., John 8:44 [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Devil\|Devil]]).

	- Sahtan 
	- The English word Satan comes from the Hebrew sahtan, which can be translated as opponent, adversary, and enemy. The word goes to the heart of his essence.
	- He is not an enemy—but the Enemy, the one at enmity with all.
	- When the ancient scribes had to translate the Hebrew sahtan into Greek, they chose the word Diabolos //Devil//.
	- As evil, by nature, stands in opposition to existence, so the name of the entity that personifies it means the Opponent, the Opposer, and which in Hebrew is sahtan or Satan. And as evil, by nature, stands in enmity with all that is, so the name of the being that embodies it is the Enemy, the Adversary, both of which are translations of sahtan and diabolos, Satan and the Devil.


#### My Observations and Opinions
- There is a main adversary, usually referred to as dragon or serpent. And many satans/adversaries and stars (aka lucifers). And a THIRD of the stars were swept to earth by the Great Dragon's tail. And the Great Dragon and those with him were thrown to the earth. Reveationl 12:4
- There are several main satans/adversaries named in the Bible, Azazel, Baal, Ashtaroth, Moloch, Beelzebub, to name a few of the more well known ones. They are all hasatans/satans. Anyone standing in opposition to Yah/God or as an accuser is a satan.
- Numbers 22:22 But the Af Elohim was kindled as he was going; and the Malach Hashem stood in the derech (road) ha’satan against him  - The Angel of the Lord is satan
- 1 Samuel 29:4 - the Philistines are the satans
- Luke 10 - context: the disciples just came back from casting out demons - Jesus says, I was seeing the adversaries falling like lightning ... for his disciples, this is a wink and nod, a hyperlinked to Isaiah 14 as is the custom for Jewish teachers. It’s meant to convey a whole set of ideas from the passage quoted. Picture yourself being one of the disciples and your teachers says this and all of a sudden you recall the entire premise and thoughts conveyed in Isaiah 14.
- Take a deeper look at Isaiah 14, who is the you that has fallen from heaven? It could metaphorically be both the king and the principality set over his land - think Tower of Babylon. However, there is no doubt the king is the one being spoken.
- There is a "star" referenced in Revelation 9 as falling from Heaven to earth after the fifth trumpet. And a THIRD of mankind is killed by three plagues. 
	- Was this trumpet sounded already in Isaiah 14? If so, then they could be the same being. If not, then they are not. 
	- Did Revelation 9 happen before, during, or after Revelation 12? Isaiah 14? Zechariah 3?
	- There is/was a war in heaven and the dragon's tail sweeps away a third of the stars of heaven down to earth. - indicating multiple stars fell from heaven to earth. (Rev 12)
- And the great Dragon, that NACHASH HaKadmoni (Ancient Serpent) was thrown down, the one being called the Malshin (Informer, Accuser/Devil) and Hasatan (Accuser, Adversary/Satan), the one deceiving the whole inhabited world. He was thrown to ha’aretz (the earth) and the malachim of him were thrown down with him.
	- this is “the one” deceiving the whole inhabited world - the main adversary. He being called Malshin/devil and hasatan/satan - his name is not Satan, he is the main adversary/satan. He can not be in multiple places at once. And he is not all knowing. He’s the general of the oppositional army.
	- also indicating multiple adversaries/hasatan were thrown to earth - we wrestle against multiple satans, spiritual powers and principalities
	- this malshin and hasatan is bound in Revelation 20.
- Is Rev 12 a past, present, or future event? Is this Ancient Serpent the same one called the Great Dragon in Rev 9?
	- No matter the answers, it is very clear in Biblical context, there is not one being named “Satan,” especially if you get back to the original languages.
