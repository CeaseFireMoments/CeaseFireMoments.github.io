# Additional Notes:

## Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History

These, although illustrious among their countrymen for many generations, never called their followers “Christians” from their own typical name of Christ. Neither was there ever any divine honor paid to them, nor were their followers ready to die for them after they were dead. Never did so great a commotion arise among all the nations of the earth in respect to anyone of that Age; for those mere symbols could not act with such power as our Savior has done. 

Although He did not receive the same honors as those mentioned above, He is called Christ more than all of them. He is the only one and true Christ of God and has filled the whole earth with the sacred name of Christians. Not bestowing the types to His followers, but the real virtues and doctrines of truth, not anointing with oil but the Holy Spirit by participation in the unbegotten deity of the Father.

But the great and convincing evidence of that incorporeal and divine power in Jesus, is the fact that He alone, of all that have ever existed to the present day, even now is known by the title of Christ, among all men over the world; and with this title He is acknowledged and professed by all and commemorated both among Barbarians and Greeks. Even to this day He is honored as King by His followers throughout the world, and is admired as more than a prophet, and is glorified as the true and only high priest of God.
