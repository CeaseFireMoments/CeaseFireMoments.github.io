# Extra Biblical Information
## Landmarks:

## Archeology: 
- Corroborates 2 Kings 3 (Moab's revolt after Ahab's death) but omits specifics like battles.
	- Basalt inscription erected by Mesha, king of Moab (ca. 840 BCE), discovered in 1868 at Dhiban (biblical Dibon), Moab. Now in the Louvre Museum.
		- Lines 4–8: "Omri was king of Israel, and he oppressed Moab many days, for Chemosh (Moab's god) was angry with his land. And his son followed in his footsteps, and he also said: 'I will oppress Moab.' In my days he spoke, but I triumphed over his house. And Israel perished forever... Omri took possession of the whole land of Medeba, and lived there in his days and half the days of his son—forty years."
- Black limestone obelisk from Nimrud (ancient Kalhu, Iraq), now in the British Museum. Records 31 years of Shalmaneser's reign, with reliefs of tribute scenes.
	- Second register (ca. 841 BCE): Relief depicts "Jehu, son of Omri" (Ia-ua mar Humri) bowing and paying tribute (silver, gold, vessels, spears). [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]] is called "House of Omri" (Bit-Humri).
    - Earlier annals (integrated text) reference the Qarqar campaign against Ahab (as in Kurkh).
    - "Son of Omri" uses "son" genealogically for Jehu (not literal son of Omri, but of the dynasty). Illustrates the enduring "House of Omri" as a vassal power post-Ahab. Focuses on tribute (a "work" of submission), not statutes or idolatry.
- Assyrian kings (e.g., Tiglath-Pileser III, ca. 734 BCE) repeatedly call Israel "House of Omri" (Bit-Humri) in later texts, indicating the dynasty's lasting label for ~150 years. 
- Oldest surviving image of an Israelite (likely Jehu or delegate); confirms Assyrian view of Omrides as a stable entity. On permanent display at the British Museum in London, UK. https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1848-1104-1
