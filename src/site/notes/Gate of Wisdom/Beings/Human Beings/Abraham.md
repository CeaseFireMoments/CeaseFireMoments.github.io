# Land and Dwelling
## Journeys
- God spoke to Abraham (https://www.gotquestions.org/life-Abraham.html) several times. Many of their conversations were filled with instruction, but God also gave Abraham glimpses of the future. In fact, in their first meeting, God started by telling Abram (75 yrs) to leave his country and travel to a new place (Genesis 12:1 (https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2012.1)) and then went straight into a blessing that doubled as a prophecy of the future (Genesis 12:2–3 (https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2012.2%E2%80%933)).

# Righteousness and Unrighteousness
## Righteousness
- His belief in God’s promise is counted as righteousness (Genesis 15:6), and his obedience, especially in the near-sacrifice of Isaac, underscores his devotion.

## Unrighteousness
- 

# Other

[[Gate of Wisdom/Covenant/Abrahamic\|Abrahamic]] Covenant
- In Genesis 12:2-3, God promises to bless Abram, make him a great nation, and bless all families of the earth through him.
- In Genesis 15, God reaffirms the promise of numerous offspring and land, sealing it with a covenant ceremony. When Abram believes God, it is “counted to him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6), a key verse cited in Romans 4:3 and Galatians 3:6 to highlight his faith.
- In Genesis 17, God changes Abram’s name to Abraham (“father of a multitude”) and establishes circumcision as the covenant sign. God promises Abraham a son through Sarah, Isaac, and that his descendants will possess Canaan.
- In Genesis 22:15-18, after Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac, God reiterates the promise, emphasizing that all nations will be blessed through his offspring.

## Events in History
- Egypt: In Genesis 12:10-20, due to famine, Abraham goes to Egypt and, fearing for his life, asks Sarai to say she is his sister. Pharaoh takes her but is afflicted by God, and Abraham leaves with wealth after the truth is revealed. A similar incident occurs with Abimelech in Genesis 20.
- Lot’s Separation: In Genesis 13, Abraham and Lot separate due to land disputes. Abraham generously lets Lot choose first, and Lot picks the Jordan Valley. God then reaffirms the land promise to Abraham.
- Rescue of Lot: In Genesis 14, Abraham defeats kings who captured Lot, showing his leadership and bravery. He meets Melchizedek, priest-king of Salem, who blesses him, and Abraham gives him a tithe.
- Hagar and Ishmael: In Genesis 16, impatient for an heir, Abraham, at Sarai’s urging, fathers Ishmael through Hagar, Sarai’s servant. God later blesses Ishmael but clarifies Isaac as the covenant heir (Genesis 17:19-21).
- Sodom and Gomorrah: In Genesis 18-19, Abraham intercedes with God to spare Sodom, showing his compassion and boldness. God destroys the cities but spares Lot.
- Isaac’s Birth and Sacrifice: In Genesis 21, Sarah bears Isaac, the promised son. In Genesis 22, God tests Abraham by commanding him to sacrifice Isaac. Abraham obeys but is stopped by God, who provides a ram instead, affirming Abraham’s faith.
- Sarah’s Death and Burial: In Genesis 23, Abraham mourns Sarah’s death and purchases the cave of Machpelah to bury her, securing a foothold in Canaan.
- Keturah and Later Life: In Genesis 25:1-6, Abraham marries Keturah, who bears six sons. He sends their descendants away with gifts, ensuring Isaac’s inheritance. Abraham dies at 175 (Genesis 25:7-8) and is buried with Sarah.
