# Extra Biblical Information
## Landmarks:
- Nehemiah's Wall and Gates of Jerusalem: The walls rebuilt by Nehemiah in the 5th century B.C.E., including the Sheep Gate (northern entrance), Fish Gate (western side), Dung Gate (southern side), East Gate, and the gate beneath the Golden Gate (eastern side). These are referenced in historical reconstructions and tied to modern archaeological sites in Jerusalem's Old City walls.
- Tower of Hananeel (or Hananel): A northwestern corner tower in the rebuilt fortifications, associated with the Sheep Gate; remnants linked to Persian-period structures in the City of David excavations.
- Great Projecting Tower: Possibly identified with the Northern Tower in the City of David, a key defensive feature described in Nehemiah's account.
- Broad Wall: A section of the western wall extending toward the royal palace, corroborated by excavations showing Persian-era construction.
- Furnaces Tower: Located at the Temple Mount's southwest corner, part of the defensive perimeter rebuilt under Nehemiah.
- Shushan (Susa) Palace: The Persian royal court where Nehemiah served as cupbearer; a major Achaemenid landmark in modern Iran, with ruins attesting to its grandeur during Artaxerxes I's reign.

## Archeology: 
- Northern Tower and Persian-Period Ceramics (City of David): Excavations in 1978 by Benjamin Mazar uncovered a Persian-period (5th century B.C.E.) ceramic layer at the base of the Northern Tower, providing evidence for the resettlement of Babylonian exiles and aligning with Nehemiah's wall-building timeline. The tower's rushed construction matches the 52-day urgency described.
- Persian Royal Seals: Two 5th-century B.C.E. seals discovered in 2020 by the Israel Antiquities Authority in Old Jerusalem, confirming Persian administrative presence during Nehemiah's governorship and the city's role as a provincial center.
