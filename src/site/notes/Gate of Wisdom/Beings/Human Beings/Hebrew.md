Regarding the title 'Abram the Hebrew', there are several theories:

- A descendant of Hebrews - Many scholars believe the word Hebrew was derived from Eber (Great…great grandfather of Abram). If that is true, then there was many Hebrew families and peoples (probably in the land of Ur) when Abram was born.  So he wouldn’t be the first Hebrew.
- Writing of Torah: Commemorating the action that Abram was obedient and crossed over out of Ur. 
-  Honor - Due to his warrior spirit and champion of the people.
