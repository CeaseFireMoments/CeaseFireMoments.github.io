# Birth and Ancestors
- **Timeframe:** Patriarchal period (ca. 1900–1800 BC, during the lifetime of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob)
- **Place:** Haran (upper Mesopotamia)
- **Father:** Laban (son of Bethuel, grandson of Nahor – [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]]’s brother)
- **Mother:** Not named in the Bible
- **Sibling:** Younger sister [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Rachel\|Rachel]] ([[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Jacob\|Jacob]]’s second and favored wife)
- **Hebrew meaning of Name:** Leah (לֵאָה) – possibly “weary,” “tired,” or “cow” (from Akkadian littu); some connect it to “wild cow” or “mistress”
- **Other Relatives of Note:**  
  - Uncle: [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Rebekah\|Rebekah]]’s brother (Laban)  
  - Cousins: Jacob (her future husband)  
  - Grandfather: Bethuel  
  - Great-grandfather: Nahor (Abraham’s brother)

# Marriage and Descendants
- **Spouse #1:** Jacob (also called Israel) – her only husband
	- **Story:** Genesis 29  
	  Laban deceived Jacob on his wedding night: Jacob worked 7 years for Rachel, but Laban substituted Leah (the elder daughter). Jacob married Leah first (unknowingly until morning). He then worked another 7 years for Rachel. Leah was given to Jacob as wife according to the custom that the older daughter must marry first (Gen 29:26). God saw that Leah was “hated” (less loved than Rachel) and opened her womb while Rachel was barren (Gen 29:31).
	- **Children:** (all with Jacob)
	  1. Reuben (firstborn son)
	  2. Simeon
	  3. [[Zunpublished/Levi\|Levi]] (ancestor of the Levitical priesthood)
	  4. [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Judah\|Judah]] (ancestor of King David and the Messianic line)
	  5. Issachar
	  6. Zebulun
	  7. Dinah (only daughter mentioned)
	  Leah also gave her maidservant Zilpah to Jacob as a concubine; Zilpah bore:
	  - Gad
	  - Asher  
	  (These two sons are sometimes counted among “Leah’s children” in broader tribal listings because they came through her maid – Gen 30:9–13; 35:26; 46:18)

- **Other Descendants of Note:**
  - Through Judah: [[Zunpublished/David\|David]], [[Zunpublished/Solomon\|Solomon]], and ultimately [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Jesus\|Jesus]] Christ (Matthew 1:2–3, 16; Luke 3:33–34)
  - Through Levi: [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Moses\|Moses]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Aaron\|Aaron]], and the entire priestly tribe

# Land and Dwelling
## Dwelling Places
- Haran (birthplace, with her father Laban)
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/Canaan\|Canaan]] (after marrying Jacob): lived in tents as a nomadic wife
  - Succoth (temporarily)
  - Shechem
  - [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/Bethel\|Bethel]]
  - Hebron/[[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/Mamre\|Mamre]] (later in life with Jacob and Isaac)

## Journeys
- From Haran to Canaan with Jacob, Rachel, the children, servants, and flocks (Genesis 31)
- Within Canaan: Shechem → Bethel → Ephrath (near Bethlehem) → Mamre/Hebron

# Occupation and Military
- No occupation mentioned other than wife, mother, and household manager in a pastoral nomadic family
- No military involvement recorded

# Medical and Death
- Weak eyes/tender eyes (Gen 29:17 – Hebrew רַכּוֹת, often translated “weak” or “delicate”)
- Initially fertile (God opened her womb when Rachel was barren); bore six sons and one daughter
- Death: Died before Jacob returned to Isaac in Hebron (she is not mentioned as alive when Jacob meets Esau again or when Isaac dies)
- Burial: Buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron, the family tomb purchased by Abraham (Gen 49:29–31; Jacob’s instructions: “There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah”)

# Righteousness and Unrighteousness
## Righteousness
- God showed compassion on Leah because she was unloved (Gen 29:31–35); she acknowledged God’s hand in giving her children (naming speeches: “Surely the LORD has looked on my affliction,” “The LORD has heard,” etc.)
- Praised the Lord repeatedly in naming her sons (Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah – all names reference God’s favor and hearing her)
- No sin or rebellion attributed to her in Scripture

## Unrighteousness
- Participated (willingly or unwillingly) in her father Laban’s deception of Jacob on the wedding night
- Competed with Rachel using children and mandrakes (Gen 30:14–16), saying “I have hired my husband” with the mandrakes – shows the strained sister rivalry, though not explicitly condemned

# Other
- Gave her maid Zilpah to Jacob when she temporarily stopped bearing children (Gen 30:9)
- Her firstborn Reuben later lost the birthright privileges partly because he slept with Bilhah (Rachel’s maid), which may reflect poorly on Leah’s household oversight, though the text does not blame her
- Jacob’s dying words place her burial in the patriarchs’ tomb as a mark of honor (Gen 49:31)

# Extra Biblical Information
The Bible contains no extra-biblical archaeological or landmark information about Leah specifically.

## Landmarks:
- None named after her in Scripture

## Archeology:
- No direct archaeological evidence for Leah herself; the Cave of Machpelah (Tomb of the Patriarchs) in Hebron is venerated as her burial place (along with Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, and Jacob) by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions, but no inscription or artifact confirms her individual presence.
