The term “antichrist” appears only in 1–2 John and refers both to a spirit already at work and to many individuals; the singular end-time figure is never called “the Antichrist” in Revelation but is generally identified with the first [[Gate of Wisdom/B/Beast\|Beast]] and the “man of lawlessness.”

John never calls the Antichrist the beast, however, traits John ascribes to “the Antichrist” (ὁ ἀντίχριστος) is fulfilled in the person of the first [[Gate of Wisdom/B/Beast\|Beast]] (the beast of the sea) of Revelation 13. 
- Singular - "The Antichrist"
	- Future; 1 John 2:18 "…that the Antichrist is coming”
	- Present, Future; 1 John 2:22 “This is the Antichrist”
	- Present, Future; 1 John 4:3 “This is the (spirit) of the Antichrist”
	- Present, Future; 1 John 4:3 “…which you have heard is coming, and now is already in the world”
	- Future; 2 John 7 “This is the deceiver and the Antichrist”
- Plural - “spirit of the Antichrist”
	- Present; 1 John 2:18 “…even now many antichrists have come”

Paul never calls the man of lawlessness the Antichrist or beast, however, the descriptive detail Paul gives in 2 Thessalonians 2:3–10 aligns with the first beast of Revelation 13. 
- Singular - "the lawless one"
	- Future; 2 Thessalonians 2:3 “the man of sin … the son of destruction,” “unless the apostasy comes first and the man of sin is revealed”
	- Future; 2 Thessalonians 2:4 “the one who opposes … so that he sits in the temple of God”
	- Preset, Future; 2 Thessalonians 2:6 “and now you know what is restraining … until he is taken out of the way”
	- Future; 2 Thessalonians 2:7 “and then the lawless one will be revealed”
	- Future; 2 Thessalonians 2:8 “whom the Lord will consume … at the brightness of His coming”
	- Future; 2 Thessalonians 2:9 “whose coming is according to the working of The Adversary/Accuser” See: [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Satan\|Satan]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Heavenly Beings/Dragon\|Dragon]]
- Plural - "spirit of the lawlessness"
	- Present; 2 Thessalonians 2 “for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work”

# Medical and Death
- the beast/Antichrist figure is cast alive into the lake of fire at Christ’s return – Rev 19:20)
# Righteousness and Unrighteousness
## Righteousness
- every description is wholly opposed to God

## Unrighteousness
- Denies that Jesus is the Christ and denies the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22)
- Does not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh (1 John 4:3; 2 John 7)
- Is the “man of lawlessness / son of destruction” who exalts himself above every so-called god, proclaiming himself to be God, and sits in the temple of God (2 Thess 2:3–4, 8–9)
- Performs great signs and wonders to deceive (2 Thess 2:9; Rev 13:13–14)
- Is empowered by Satan (2 Thess 2:9; Rev 13:2–4)
- Makes war against the saints and overcomes them (Rev 13:7)
- Is worshiped by the world (Rev 13:4, 8)

# Define
- Hebrew: No direct Hebrew word appears in Scripture. The closest conceptual equivalents in Hebrew translations of the New Testament are:
	- mashiach sheker (מָשִׁיחַ שֶׁקֶר) = “false messiah/anointed one”)
	- sometimes ben-beliyya‘al (בֶּן־בְּלִיַּעַל) = “son of Belial/worthlessness,” used for the “man of lawlessness” in 2 Thess 2:3).
- Greek: antichristos (ἀντίχριστος) - Literal meaning: “one who is against the Anointed One” or “one who opposes/substitutes for the Anointed One”
	- anti (ἀντί) = “against” and/or “in place of/substitute”
	- christos (χριστός0) = “anointed one / Christ”  

# Related words
- “the lawless one” (2 Thess 2:8)
- “the son of destruction/perdition” (2 Thess 2:3)
- “[[Gate of Wisdom/B/Beast\|Beast]]” (Revelation 13 and 19)
- “the man of sin/lawlessness” (2 Thess 2:3)

# Additional Info
- The actual word ἀντίχριστος (antichrist) appears only five times in the entire Bible, all in the writings of John (1 John 2:18 [twice], 2:22, 4:3; 2 John 7).
- John uses it both for a singular coming figure (“the antichrist” – 1 John 2:18) and for many who already exist (“many antichrists have come” – 1 John 2:18; 4:3; 2 John 7).
- The singular end-time figure elsewhere called the beast or the man of lawlessness is never explicitly called “the Antichrist” in Revelation or Paul’s letters; the identification is by theological connection, not by the use of the exact term.
