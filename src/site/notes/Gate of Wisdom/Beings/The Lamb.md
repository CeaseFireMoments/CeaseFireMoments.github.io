# The Lamb is the Messiah
- Isaiah 53:7 describes the suffering servant (recognized as the Messiah) as a **seh (שֶׂה)** — lamb — led to the slaughter: "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb (seh) to the slaughter."
- John 1:29 — John the Baptist declares: "Behold the Lamb (amnos, ἀμνός) of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." This directly applies the sacrificial lamb imagery to the Messiah.
- Acts 8:32-35 — Philip explains Isaiah 53:7-8 to the Ethiopian eunuch as referring to Jesus, confirming the lamb-like suffering servant is the Messiah.
- Revelation repeatedly presents the Lamb (arnion, ἀρνίον) in Messianic roles: worthy to open the scroll (Revelation 5:5-9, linked to the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David — clear Messianic titles from Genesis 49:9-10 and Isaiah 11:1,10).
- The Lamb on the throne rules the nations (Revelation 12:5; 19:15), fulfilling Messianic prophecies (Psalm 2:9).

# The Lamb is Jesus
- Revelation 5:5-6 explicitly equates the Lion of Judah/Root of David (Messianic titles) with "a Lamb (arnion) as it had been slain."
- Revelation 7:17 — "For the Lamb (arnion) which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them" echoes Jesus' own words as the Good Shepherd (John 10:11-14).
- Revelation 17:14 — "the Lamb (arnion) shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings" — titles applied to Jesus (Revelation 19:16; 1 Timothy 6:15).
- Revelation 19:11-16 describes the returning rider called Faithful and True, with a name "The Word of God" (John 1:1,14 — Jesus), and on His thigh "King of kings, and Lord of lords" — the same Lamb who was slain now weds the bride (Revelation 19:7-9).
- Revelation 22:1,3 — The Lamb (arnion) is on the throne with God, sharing divine worship (Revelation 5:13; 22:3-4), consistent only with Jesus as God incarnate (John 1:1; 20:28).
