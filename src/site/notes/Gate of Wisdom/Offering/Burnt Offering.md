## The Last
Details from Josephus: Josephus describes the temple’s destruction in 70 CE, noting that sacrifices continued until the temple was overrun. He records that during the siege, priests maintained daily sacrifices despite shortages of animals and resources (The Jewish War, VI.2.1). The last burnt offerings likely occurred shortly before the temple’s destruction in August 70 CE, as priests struggled to uphold the daily offerings (two lambs, morning and evening) amidst the chaos. Josephus does not pinpoint an exact final sacrifice but implies that sacrifices ceased when the temple was burned and razed.

Samaritan Practices: The Samaritans, a distinct religious group, maintained their own sacrificial practices on Mount Gerizim, including burnt offerings, into late antiquity. Samaritan chronicles, such as the Kitab al-Tarikh of Abu’l Fath (14th century, recounting earlier traditions), suggest that Samaritan sacrifices, including burnt offerings for Passover, continued sporadically. However, these were not considered valid by mainstream Judaism, and their frequency diminished under Roman and Byzantine persecution. Exact dates for the cessation of Samaritan burnt offerings are unclear, but they likely persisted into the 4th or 5th century CE in limited form.

There were brief attempts to revive temple sacrifices, notably under Emperor Julian the Apostate (361-363 CE), who sought to rebuild the Jerusalem temple and restore Jewish sacrifices to undermine Christianity. Historical accounts, such as those by Ammianus Marcellinus (Res Gestae 23.1), indicate that preparations began, but the project was abandoned after an earthquake or fire, and no burnt offerings were performed.

Christian sources, such as early Church Fathers (e.g., Tertullian, Against Marcion, circa 208 CE), argue that burnt offerings ended with Christ’s sacrifice, symbolically fulfilled on the cross. However, this is a theological claim, not a historical record of the last physical burnt offering, which continued in the temple until 70 CE.

Outside Judaism, burnt offerings were common in other ancient Near Eastern religions (e.g., Canaanite, Greek, Roman). These continued beyond 70 CE but are distinct from the biblical burnt offerings, which were specific to Israelite worship. For example, Roman animal sacrifices persisted until the Christianization of the Roman Empire in the 4th century CE, but these are not relevant to the Mosaic system.

## Key Early Church Fathers and Their References to Burnt Offerings

1. Justin Martyr (c. 100–165 CE):

	* Work: Dialogue with Trypho (a debate with a Jewish interlocutor).
	* References to Burnt Offerings:

		* In Dialogue with Trypho (Chapters 22, 40), Justin argues that Old Testament sacrifices, including burnt offerings, were temporary and prophetic of Christ’s ultimate sacrifice. He cites Malachi 1:10-11, which predicts that God will reject Jewish sacrifices and accept offerings from the Gentiles, interpreting this as fulfilled in the Eucharist and spiritual worship of Christians.
		* He asserts that burnt offerings were instituted not because God needed them but to restrain Israel’s idolatry and point to Christ. For example, in Chapter 22, he writes: “God, knowing that it would be difficult to wean you from sacrificing to idols, gave you a temporary institution in sacrifices, which were to cease when the true sacrifice, Jesus Christ, appeared.”
		* Justin connects the cessation of burnt offerings to the destruction of the temple in 70 CE, seeing it as divine confirmation that Christ’s sacrifice replaced the old system.
	* Significance: Justin emphasizes typology, viewing burnt offerings as shadows of Christ’s complete self-offering on the cross, and he uses their cessation to argue for Christianity’s superiority over Judaism.<br>
2. Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130–202 CE):

	* Work: Against Heresies (especially Book IV).
	* References to Burnt Offerings:

		* In Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 17), Irenaeus discusses the Old Testament sacrifices, including burnt offerings, as preparatory for Christ’s coming. He argues that God accepted these sacrifices from the Jews temporarily but intended them to be fulfilled in the “pure oblation” of the Eucharist.
		* He cites Psalm 40:6-8 (quoted in Hebrews 10:5-7), which states that God did not desire burnt offerings but a body prepared for Christ, to show that the Mosaic sacrifices were inferior and pointed to Jesus’ sacrifice.
		* Irenaeus explains that burnt offerings were given to teach Israel dependence on God and to prevent them from adopting pagan practices, but they became obsolete after Christ’s death, which offered true atonement.
	* Significance: Irenaeus frames burnt offerings as part of God’s pedagogical plan, fulfilled in Christ and replaced by spiritual sacrifices like prayer and the Eucharist.<br>
3. Tertullian  (c. 155–240 CE):

	* Work: Against Marcion and Against the Jews.
	* References to Burnt Offerings:

		* In Against Marcion (Book II, Chapter 22), Tertullian defends the Old Testament Law, including burnt offerings, as divinely instituted but temporary. He argues that they were “types” of Christ’s sacrifice, which offered complete atonement, unlike the repeated burnt offerings that could not remove sin, The Gospel of Marcion (Chapter 2, Section 2) also references burnt offerings, interpreting them as prophetic of Christ’s self-offering.
		* In Against the Jews (Chapter 5), Tertullian links the cessation of burnt offerings to the temple’s destruction in 70 CE, viewing it as God’s judgment and proof that the Mosaic Law was fulfilled in Christ. He writes: “The sacrifices of the Jews, such as burnt offerings, have ceased, because the true sacrifice has been offered in Christ.”
	* Significance: Tertullian uses burnt offerings to contrast the temporary nature of the Law with the eternal efficacy of Christ’s sacrifice, emphasizing their obsolescence post-70 CE.<br>
4. Origen (c. 184–253 CE):

	* Work: Homilies on Leviticus and Against Celsus.
	* References to Burnt Offerings:

		* In his Homilies on Leviticus (Homily 1), **Origen provides allegorical interpretations of burnt offerings, seeing them as symbols of the soul’s complete dedication to God. He connects the total consumption of the offering by fire to Christ’s self-emptying on the cross and believers’ call to offer themselves as “living sacrifices” (**Romans 12:1).
		* Origen explains that burnt offerings were necessary under the Old Covenant to teach spiritual truths but were no longer needed after Christ’s perfect offering. He writes: “The burnt offering, wholly consumed, prefigured Christ, who gave Himself entirely for our sins.”
		* In Against Celsus (Book VIII, Chapter 26), he responds to pagan critiques by arguing that Christian worship, without physical sacrifices like burnt offerings, is superior because it offers spiritual sacrifices of prayer and righteousness.
	* Significance: Origen’s allegorical approach transforms burnt offerings into a spiritual metaphor, emphasizing their fulfillment in Christ and the Christian life.<br>
5. Cyprian of Carthage (c. 200–258 CE):

	* Work: Letters and Treatise on the Lord’s Prayer.
	* References to Burnt Offerings:

		* Cyprian rarely mentions burnt offerings explicitly but refers to Old Testament sacrifices in general as preparatory for the Eucharist. In Letter 63, he compares the Eucharist to the “pure offering” of Malachi 1:11, which replaced burnt offerings.
		* He implies that burnt offerings ended with the temple’s destruction, as God now accepts the spiritual sacrifices of Christians, such as martyrdom and charity (Treatise on Works and Alms, Chapter 16).
	* Significance: Cyprian focuses on the Eucharist and Christian virtues as the new form of sacrifice, implicitly viewing burnt offerings as obsolete.<br>
6. Eusebius of Caesarea  (c. 260–339 CE):

	* Work: Church History and Demonstration of the Gospel.
	* References to Burnt Offerings:

		* In Demonstration of the Gospel (Book I, Chapter 10), Eusebius argues that burnt offerings were a concession to Israel’s weakness, designed to curb idolatry and prefigure Christ. He cites the temple’s destruction as evidence that God no longer desires such sacrifices, pointing to the spread of Christianity as the new universal worship.
		* He references Isaiah 1:11 (“I delight not in the blood of bullocks”) to show that burnt offerings were never God’s ultimate desire, fulfilled instead by Christ’s sacrifice.
	* Significance: Eusebius uses burnt offerings to highlight the historical shift from Judaism to Christianity, tying their end to both Christ’s work and the temple’s destruction.<br>
7. Athanasius of Alexandria (c. 296–373 CE):

	* Work: On the Incarnation.
	* References to Burnt Offerings:

		* In On the Incarnation (Chapter 20), Athanasius briefly mentions Old Testament sacrifices, including burnt offerings, as insufficient for salvation. He argues that only Christ’s death could achieve what burnt offerings symbolized: complete atonement and dedication to God.
		* He does not discuss their cessation explicitly but implies their obsolescence by emphasizing Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice, echoing Hebrews 10:10.
	* Significance: Athanasius focuses on Christ’s incarnation and sacrifice as the fulfillment of all sacrifices, rendering burnt offerings unnecessary.

## Burnt Offerings and Jesus

### Pleasing Offering to God:
Burnt Offering: The burnt offering was described as a “sweet savour unto the Lord” (Lev. 1:9, 13, 17), indicating God’s acceptance of the sacrifice when offered in faith and obedience.

Jesus: Jesus’ sacrifice is portrayed as pleasing and acceptable to God, fully satisfying divine justice.
Ephesians 5:2: Christ “hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour,” directly paralleling the burnt offering’s pleasing aroma.

### Unblemished Sacrifice:
Burnt Offering: The animal for a burnt offering had to be “without blemish” (Lev. 1:3, 10), symbolizing purity and suitability for God’s altar.

Jesus: Jesus is depicted as sinless and perfect, making Him the ideal sacrifice.
1 Peter 1:19: Believers are redeemed “with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.”

Hebrews 7:26-27: Jesus is described as “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,” offering Himself once, unlike the daily burnt offerings that required repeated unblemished animals.

### Substitutionary Role:
Burnt Offering: The offerer laid hands on the animal (Lev. 1:4), symbolizing the transfer of guilt or the identification of the offerer with the sacrifice, which bore the penalty in their place.

Jesus: Jesus took on humanity’s sins, acting as a substitute for sinners.
Isaiah 53:5-6 (quoted in the New Testament context, e.g., 1 Pet. 2:24): “The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,” paralleling the laying of hands in the burnt offering.

2 Corinthians 521: God “hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him,” reflecting the substitutionary nature of Jesus’ death, akin to the burnt offering’s role in atonement.
