# Define
- In the Hebrew Bible, the primary word for "sacrifice" is קָרְבָּן (pronounced korban). It comes from the root קרב (karav), meaning "to draw near" or "to approach." The term korban reflects the idea of bringing an offering to draw closer to God, emphasizing the relational aspect of the act rather than just the act of killing or giving up something.
- Korban is used for various types of offerings in the Torah, including animal sacrifices, grain offerings, and other gifts brought to the sanctuary (e.g., Leviticus 1–7). It encompasses burnt offerings (olah ), sin offerings (chatat), peace offerings (shelamim), and more.
- In Hebrew thought, a korban is about approaching God or restoring harmony (shalom) with Him, often through a physical gift that symbolizes devotion, atonement, or gratitude. It’s less about "sacrifice" in the sense of loss and more about an act of connection.
- While korban is the most general term for sacrifice/offering, other Hebrew words are used for specific types or aspects of sacrificial acts. In the Hebrew Bible, several Hebrew words are translated as "sacrifice" in English, each with distinct nuances and contexts. 
	- Korban (קָרְבָּן) Meaning: Derived from the root karav ("to draw near"), it denotes an offering brought near to God, encompassing both animal and non-animal offerings (e.g., grain). It’s a general term for any sacrificial gift.
	  Context: Used broadly in Leviticus and Numbers for various offerings, such as burnt offerings , sin offerings, or grain offerings  (e.g., Leviticus 1:2).
Example: Numbers 7 :13 – “His offering (korban) was one silver plate.”
Acts 24 :17
- In Greek, dōron means "gift," "offering," or "present."


## Jesus as an Offering

- **Hebrews 10:26** **For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins**, 27 but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries. 28 A man who disregards Moses’ law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 29 **How much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God**, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know him who said, “Vengeance belongs to me. I will repay,” says the Lord. Again, “The Lord will judge his people.” 31 **It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God**.

- **John 14:15**: "If you love me, you will keep my commandments (mitzvah)."
- **John 14:21**: "Whoever has my commandments (mitzvah) and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him."
- **John 15:10**: "If you keep my commandments (mitzvah), you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments (mitzvah) and abide in his love."
- **1 John 5:2-3**: "By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments (entolē). For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments (mitzvah). And his commandments (entolē) are not burdensome."

 we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
{ #27}

{ #but}
 only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
{ #28}

{ #Anyone}
 who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
{ #29}

{ #How}
 much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who as insulted the Spirit of grace?
{ #30}

{ #For}
 we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”[d] and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”[e]
{ #31}

{ #It}
 is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

- 2 Corinthians 5:21 He made the One who knew no sin to <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">become a sin offering</mark> on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.
- Romans 8:3 For what was impossible for the Torah—since it was weakened on account of the flesh—God has done. Sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">as a sin offering</mark>, He condemned sin in the flesh— (TLV)
- Hebrew 10:12, 26-29  But on the other hand, when this One offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God—  ... 26 For if we keep on sinning willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but only a terrifying expectation of judgment and a fury of fire about to devour the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the Torah of Moses dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 29 How much more severe do you think the punishment will be for the one who has trampled Ben-Elohim underfoot, and has regarded as unholy the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? (TLV)
- 1 John 2:1-2 My children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an Intercessor with the Father—the righteous Messiah Yeshua. 2 He is the atonement for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world. (TLV)
- Hebrews 9:11–14 But when Messiah appeared as Kohen Gadol of the good things that have now come, passing through the greater and more perfect Tent not made with hands (that is to say not of this creation), 12 He entered into the Holies once for all—not by the blood of goats and calves but by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, 14 how much more will the blood of Messiah—who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God—cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God? (TLV)

### Yeshua/Jesus under the renewed covenant became a guilt offering. 
- Isaiah 53:10 Yet it pleased Adonai to bruise Him. He caused Him to suffer. If He makes His soul a <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">guilt offering</mark>, He will see His offspring, He will prolong His days, and the will of Adonai will succeed by His hand.
- 1 Peter 2:23-24 When He was abused, He did not return the abuse. While suffering, He made no threats. Instead, He kept entrusting Himself to the One who judges righteously. 24 He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that we, removed from sins, might live for righteousness. “By His wounds you were healed.” (TLV)
- 1 John 1:5-10 Now this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you—that God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we say we have fellowship with Him and keep walking in the darkness, we are lying and do not practice the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of His Son Yeshua purifies us from all sin. 8 If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.  10 If we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. (TLV)
- Ephesians 5:1-3 Therefore be imitators of God, as dearly loved children; 2 and walk in love, just as Messiah also loved us[a] and gave Himself up for us as an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant aroma. 3 But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed—don’t even let these be mentioned among you, as is proper for kedoshim. (TLV)
- Hebrew 10:12, 26-29  But on the other hand, when this One offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God—  ... 26 For if we keep on sinning willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but only a terrifying expectation of judgment and a fury of fire about to devour the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the Torah of Moses dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 29 How much more severe do you think the punishment will be for the one who has trampled Ben-Elohim underfoot, and has regarded as unholy the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
