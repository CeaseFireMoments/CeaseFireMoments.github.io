The Greek authors very rarely think of ‘mourn’ as consoling.

  

Mourning isn’t always about what we experience, it’s also about what other’s experience and how we react to them and what they are going through.

  

Same word in Matthew 2:18 (comforted); Matthew 8:5 (imploring), 31 (begging), 34 (begging); Matthew 14:36 (begging); Matthew 18:29 (begged), 32 (begged); Matthew 26:53 (call upon)

Same word most often translated to beg or begging in Matthew, not mourn.

##### Second Writings

- Matthew 5:4 - they shall be comforted
- Matthew 9:15 - children of the bridechamber when the bridgroom is taken away
- Luke 6:25 - woe that laugh
- 1 Corinthians 5:2 - puffed up and have not mourned
- James 4:9 - because of sins; related to being made low before the Lord
- Revelation 18:11 - merchants of the earth
##### Hebrew Scriptures

1. Ecclesiastes 7:2-4 - the heart of the wise is in the house of the mourning
