DISCIPLE - NOUN

Hebrew - Talmid, a student who learns from his teacher and desires to follow his example.

DISCIPLE - VERB

Matthew 28 - It is interesting to note, this is the only scripture with this particular word μαθητεύσατε (mathēteusate). 

μαθητεύσατε (mathēteusate). 

The original word is a verb. Verbs are words which show an action. It’s something done. It would be a correct sentence to say, “Disciple (v) the disciple (n).”
