Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v16\|-16]], a half-shekel is a kopher (ransom) for a person’s life during a census to prevent plague. Kopher derives from kipper. This offering functions as a kopher for lives (verses 15-16), put something in place of ones life, substituting for the person to prevent death. The same structure is here as in Leviticus 17. The half-shekel is the ransom of ones life. The animal is in place of the person.
* Leviticus 17:11 uses the same structure. The animal’s blood, representing its life, is a kopher on the outer altar (inner altar blood is only on the Day of Atonement), substituting for the offerer’s life.

## William Gilders and J. Sklar note kipper has dual meanings:

* Ransom: Substitution, as in Exodus 30 or Leviticus 17:11, where blood replaces the offerer’s life.
* Purification: Removal, as in [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/03 - Leviticus/Lev-04#v26\|Lev-04:26]], where the priest kippers to remove sin, leading to divine forgiveness (a “divine passive” indicating God forgives, not the priest). The preposition min (“from”) in Leviticus 4:26 indicates removal, like “deprive.”
* In Leviticus 12:6-7, kipper purifies a woman post-childbirth from blood flow, a ritual impurity, not sin.
