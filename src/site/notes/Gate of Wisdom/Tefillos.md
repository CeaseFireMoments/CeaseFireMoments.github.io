Communion - joining together of mind and spirit. Coming from deep in inner thoughts.

The Jewish idea is a labor of awakening the hidden love within the heart until a state of intimate union with the divine is achieved.

[[Gate of Wisdom/Mitzvot\|Mitzvot]]  ( commands-the law )) are a connection from God to his people, [[Gate of Wisdom/Tefillos\|Tefillos]] (prayers) is from his people to God.


Relative to Jeremiah 29 - the word in verse 7 is Daven - which isn't really what we typically think of when we think of prayer. And it implies a one on one conversation, not one which would include others. Daven is about creating a bond between ourselves and God. When we daven there are only two things in the universe, God and ourselves. But there isn't a coming together as one, there is an implied distance between the two. 

The word used in 12 is mitpalel can mean "to mediate" or "to judge".  The Hebrew concept is the praying person acts on themselves (to improve their character). The original meaning of the word was "judge yourself".

Interestingly enough, the word we typically think of when we think of prayer is in Jeremiah 7:16.
