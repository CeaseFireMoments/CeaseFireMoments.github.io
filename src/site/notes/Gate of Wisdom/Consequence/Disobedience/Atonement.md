# Additional Info
- atonement is a made up word by Tyndale - at one ment - reconciliation, reintegration of relationships - making them one again. However, the weakness of this is that the priest does the kipper and then the forgiveness is done directly by God and that is what completes it - the atonement isn’t done until God has forgiven. The priest is not doing the whole of the reconciliation, he’s fulfilling a pre-requisite. He is removing an impediment to the divine - human relationship. 

- The Hebrew word translated as "atonement" in Leviticus 4 is כִּפֶּר (kipper) //[[Gate of Wisdom/Ransom\|Ransom]]//
