# Additional Info
- Punishment, in the context of the Bible, refers to the divine consequences or judgments imposed by YAH (God) upon individuals, nations, or humanity for disobedience to His commands, laws, or covenant. It is an expression of God’s justice, holiness, and righteousness, often intended to correct, discipline, or bring about repentance, though it can also serve as a final judgment for unrepentant sin. Punishment may manifest as physical, spiritual, or eternal consequences, such as affliction, exile, death, or separation from God’s presence.
