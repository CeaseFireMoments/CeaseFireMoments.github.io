Grace vs Mercy = Gift vs Loyalty
- Grace = A gift of kindness — unearned, spontaneous, no obligation. Like found treasure. No prior relationship, sometimes sparks a relationship. One time favor. A stranger sees a beggar and gives him bread (Gen 39:4 – Joseph finds chen with Potiphar). “The law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.” (John 1:17)
- Mercy = Loyal, covenant love — promised, enduring, relational duty. Always sustains an existing relationship.  A father promises his son: “I will never leave you” and keeps it for life (2 Sam 7:15 – “My chesed will not depart”). The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed… it says ‘seed’ (not ‘seeds’), meaning one person, who is Christ.” If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to the promise.”(Galatians 3)

Genesis 6:8 - Amid universal wickedness, Noah receives unearned favor from God, sparing him from the flood. This is pure grace – no prior covenant or merit mentioned.

Ex 33:17 You have found chen in My sight, and I know you by name. Israel just broke the covenant. God says He will not go up with them. Moses intercedes, asking for God’s presence and favor for himself and Israel. God responds: “I will do this thing… because you have found chen.”

Psalm 103:8 God is "gracious" (chanun = full of chen, unmerited favor) and rich in "mercy" (chesed, steadfast love). Grace initiates; mercy sustains
# Define
- chen (חֵן) pronounced "khane" (with a guttural 'kh' sound).
	- Favor, grace, or beauty that is unmerited and freely given, often implying acceptance or kindness shown to someone undeserving. 
	- More about beauty, charm, or initial goodwill; less tied to covenant (e.g., not used for God's eternal promises)
	- About initial, unearned favor, - a gift of kindness or acceptance given without obligation, often as a starting point (e.g., finding favor in someone's eyes). It is not tied to a prior relationship.
	- No verse says the wicked “found chen” to escape judgment. Unearned favor given to the repentant or righteous — after or alongside justice, never instead of it.
