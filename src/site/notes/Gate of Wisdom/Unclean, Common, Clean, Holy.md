# Define
1. "**[[Gate of Wisdom/Common\|Common]]** " (Hebrew: chol; Greek: koinos): Often means ordinary or profane, as opposed to holy or set apart. In the New Testament, it can imply "defiled" in Jewish tradition (e.g., unwashed hands).
2. "**[[Gate of Wisdom/Clean\|Clean]]** " (Hebrew: tahor; Greek: katharos): Refers to ritual or moral purity, acceptable to God.
3. "**[[Gate of Wisdom/Unclean\|Unclean]]** " (Hebrew: tame; Greek: akathartos): Indicates impurity, whether physical, ceremonial, or moral, requiring separation or cleansing.
4. **[[Gate of Wisdom/Holy\|Holy]]** (qodesh): Set apart, consecrated, belonging to God, and reflecting His purity and perfection. It’s the opposite of "common" and incompatible with " unclean," often requiring " clean " as a prerequisite.

# **Notes on Combinations**
 

1. All Four (Holy, Common, Unclean, Clean): Leviticus 10:10 and Ezekiel 22:26, 44:23 explicitly list all four, focusing on priestly discernment.
2. Holy with Unclean / Clean: Leviticus 11:44-47, 20:25-26 show holiness requiring separation from uncleanness and alignment with cleanliness.
3. Holy with Common: 1 Samuel 21:4 - 5 contrasts holy bread with common, implying a clean state for access.
4. New Testament Shift: Acts 10 and Romans 14 blur old distinctions, with holiness through Christ making all potentially clean (no longer common or unclean inherently).

- Clean: Ritually pure, free from defilement, eligible to approach God or worship.
- Holy: Set apart, consecrated, reflecting God’s purity and purpose, the highest state.

# Analysis of People Groups
## General Population Outside the Israelites (Non-Israelites/Foreigners)
- Correlation: Unclean
- Impure, outside the covenant, no inherent access to God’s presence.
- Reasoning: Non-Israelites, such as Egyptians, Canaanites, or other nations, were outside God’s covenant with Israel. They were often depicted as ritually and morally impure due to idolatry, forbidden practices, and lack of adherence to Israel’s purity laws (e.g., Leviticus 18:24-27). Without access to the Tabernacle’s cleansing rituals or the Mosaic Law, their default state was "unclean" relative to God’s presence. Foreigners could join Israel (e.g., Numbers 15:15-16), but until then, they were separated from holiness. Your transcript notes their presence among the Israelites, yet their starting point is outside the covenant, aligning with uncleanness.
- Leviticus 18:24-25: “Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things, for by all these the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean…”
- Non-Israelites are unclean due to their practices, contrasting with Israel’s call to purity. Deuteronomy 18:9-12: “You shall not learn to follow the abominable practices of those nations…”
- Foreign practices render them unclean, outside God’s holy standard.
- Unclean aligns with non-Israelites because their exclusion from the covenant and association with impurity (e.g., idolatry) set them apart from Israel’s access to cleansing (Numbers 19:13).

##  Israelite Population (General Tribes, Excluding Levites)

- Correlation: Common
- Ordinary covenant members, clean when purified but not sacred.
- Reasoning: The general Israelites were God’s chosen people (Deuteronomy 7:6), living in the camp around the Tabernacle (Numbers 2). They weren’t inherently holy or set apart for sacred service like the priests; their baseline was "common"—ordinary covenant members. They could become "unclean" (e.g., Leviticus 15:2-3) or "clean" through purification (e.g., Leviticus 14:8-9), but without consecration, they remained profane rather than sacred. Your transcript describes their wavering dedication (e.g., golden calf, Exodus 32), reinforcing their common status.
- Leviticus 10:10: “You are to distinguish between the holy and the common…”
- Israelites are common unless sanctified, distinct from holy priests.
- Exodus 19:6: “You shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation…”
- They’re called to holiness but remain common without full consecration (e.g., Exodus 32:1-6, golden calf).
- Common fits the Israelites as God’s people who, while chosen, lived ordinary lives unless sanctified (e.g., Numbers 8:16-17, Levites set apart instead).
- Unclean: Non-believers (outside the “camp,” lost in fleshly desires).
- Common: Nominal Christians (outer courts, fluctuating faith).

### Sons of Levi

- From the tribe of Levi, they were set apart to assist the priests, handling the Tabernacle’s transport, setup, and guarding (Numbers 1:50-53; Numbers 3:6-9).
- They camped around the Tent of Meeting, protecting it from outsiders
- They were consecrated beyond the general Israelite population (Exodus 13:2; Numbers 8:16-18, substitutes for the firstborn), requiring ceremonial cleansing (Numbers 8:6-7, sprinkled, shaved, washed).
- They could become unclean (e.g., touching a corpse, Leviticus 21:1-4, though less strict than priests), but their baseline was higher than the common Israelite due to their service role
## Priests (Sons of Aaron)

- Correlation: Clean
- Ritually pure, set apart for service, but not the highest sanctity.
- Reasoning: The priests were consecrated from the Levites to serve in the Tabernacle’s Holy Place (Exodus 28:1). They had to maintain ritual cleanliness—washing (Exodus 30:19-21), avoiding defilement (Leviticus 21:1-4)—to offer sacrifices and handle holy things. They weren’t "common" (set apart from the general population) nor "holy" in the ultimate sense (reserved for God or the high priest’s unique role). Their default was "clean," a prerequisite for service, though they could become unclean temporarily. Your transcript positions them as the “called-out body,” requiring sustained purity.
- Exodus 30:19-21: “Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet… lest they die…”
- Cleanliness is required for priestly service in the holy place.
- Leviticus 22:3: “If any one… approaches the holy things… while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off…”
- Priests must be clean to handle holy things, not common or unclean.
- Clean suits the priests, whose role demanded purity to bridge the common and holy (Leviticus 21:6).
- Clean: Dedicated believers (priests, serving God).

## High Priest (Aaron and Successors)

- Correlation: Holy
- Consecrated, clean, and uniquely set apart to enter God’s presence.
- Reasoning: The high priest was the pinnacle of human consecration, entering the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:2-4). He was ritually clean—bathed, anointed, wearing holy garments (Exodus 28:2-4)—and uniquely set apart to approach God’s presence. His role, garments (e.g., “Holy to the Lord” on his turban, Exodus 28:36), and mediation for Israel marked him as "holy" among men, though still human and fallible (e.g., Leviticus 10:1-2). Your transcript likens him to the “called-out life,” prefiguring Christ’s ultimate holiness.
- Leviticus 16:4: “He shall put on the holy linen garments… after he has bathed…”
- The high priest’s cleanliness enables his holy role in the Most Holy Place.
- Exodus 28:36-38: “You shall make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it… ‘Holy to the Lord’… so that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things…”
- His holy status mediates between God and Israel.
- Holy matches the high priest, whose unique consecration and access to God’s presence elevated him above mere cleanliness (Leviticus 16:32-34).
- Holy: Mature disciples (high priest, fully set apart), all fulfilled in Christ (Hebrews 10:10; 1 Peter 2:9).
