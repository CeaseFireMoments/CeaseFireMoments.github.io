# Key Elements of the Covenant

## Yah-God's Promises to Jacob:
- **Land**: God vows to give Jacob and his descendants the land of Canaan (modern-day Israel/Palestine) as an everlasting inheritance (Genesis 28:13; 35:12).
- **Descendants**: Jacob's offspring will become a great nation, as numerous as the dust of the earth, spreading in all directions (Genesis 28:14; 35:11).
- **Blessing to Nations**: Through Jacob's line, all families of the earth will be blessed (Genesis 28:14), echoing the global redemptive promise from Abraham (Genesis 12:3).
- **Divine Presence and Protection**: God pledges to be with Jacob wherever he goes, guarding him and ensuring his return to the promised land (Genesis 28:15; 31:3).

## Jacob's Response:

- Jacob dreams of a ladder (or stairway) reaching to heaven, with angels ascending and descending. He awakens, declares the site holy ("the gate of heaven"), and vows to serve God, tithe, and build a pillar if God fulfills the promises. This is often seen as Jacob's personal ratification of the covenant. (Genesis 28:10–22)
- Later, after wrestling with a divine being (Genesis 32:22–32), God renames him "Israel" (meaning "he struggles with God") and blesses him, solidifying the covenant.
- The agreement is reaffirmed at Bethel in Genesis 35:9–15, where God explicitly states: "A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants" (Genesis 35:11, NIV).
