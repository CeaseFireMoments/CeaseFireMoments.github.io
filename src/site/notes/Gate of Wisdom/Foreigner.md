No foreigner may eat it, 44 but every man’s servant that is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat it. 45 Nor should a visitor or hired servant eat it. 46 It is to be eaten inside a single house. You are not to carry the meat out of the house, nor are you to break any of its bones. \[a\] 47 All the congregation of Israel must keep it. 48 But **if an outsider dwells with you, who would keep the Passover for Adonai, all his males must be circumcised. Then let him draw near and keep it****. He** **will be like one who is nativ** **e** **to the land.** But no uncircumcised person may eat from it. 49 **The same Torah applies to the native as well as the outsider who dwells among you.”**

Ezekiel 47:21-23

21 You are to divide this land for yourselves to the tribes of Israel. 22 So you are to divide it by lot for an inheritance for you **and for the outsiders who dwell among you**, whoever bears children among you. They will be to you like the native-born of Bnei-Yisrael; they will be allotted an inheritance along with you among the tribes of Israel. 23 In whatever tribe **the outsider lives**, there you will give him his inheritance.” It is a declaration of Adonai.

  

Isaiah 56 Thus says Adonai:

“Preserve justice, do righteousness. For My salvation is about to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.2 Blessed is the one who does this, the son of man who takes hold of it, who keeps from profaning Shabbat, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.

3 **Do not let a son of a foreigner who has joined himself to Adonai\[a\] say, ‘Adonai will surely exclude me from His people.**”

6 Also the foreigners who join themselves to Adonai, to minister to Him, and to love the Name of Adonai, and to be His servants—

all who keep from profaning Shabbat, and hold fast to My covenant—7 these I will bring to My holy mountain, and let them rejoice in My House of Prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar. For My House will be called a House of Prayer for all nations.”\[c\]
