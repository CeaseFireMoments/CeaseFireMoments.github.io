# Define
- Not in right standing with Yah/God, describes actions, behaviors, or individuals that are contrary to God’s moral law, justice, or righteousness. It refers to those who sin, act unjustly, or fail to align with God’s standards of holiness and justice (e.g., Psalm 92:15, Romans 1:18, 1 John 5:17).- 
- There is no single dedicated Hebrew adjective exactly “unrighteous,” but Scripture expresses the idea with:
	- rasha (רָשָׁע) – wicked, guilty, morally wrong (Prov 11:5; Ps 1:4–6).  
	- ‘awal / ‘awlah (עַוַל/עַוְלָה) – unjust, wrong, iniquitous (Ps 92:15; Isa 10:1).   
- adikos (ἄδικος) – unjust, wrong, not conforming to God’s standard (Luke 16:10–11; 1 Cor 6:9).
- Contrasts directly with **δίκαιος** ([[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Righteous\|Righteous]])
