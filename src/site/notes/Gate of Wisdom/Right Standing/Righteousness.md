# Define
- **Hebrew: tsedaqah (צְדָקָה)**
	- - Right conduct, just actions, faithfulness to God’s covenant (Gen 15:6; Deut 6:25; Ps 119:142).
    
- **Greek** - dikaiosynē (**δικαιοσύνη **  
	- Being in accord with God’s will and justice (Matt 5:6; Rom 6:13; Phil 1:11).
	- In the Septuagint, (Righteous) tsedeq is most commonly translated as δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosynē), which means "righteousness," "justice," or "uprightness." This Greek term captures the idea of moral integrity and adherence to divine or ethical standards. For example, in Isaiah 1:26, where tsedeq is used to describe a city of righteousness, the LXX uses dikaiosynē.
	- In the Septuagint, tsedaqah is also frequently translated as δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosynē), but in contexts where it refers to acts of charity or benevolence, it may be rendered as ἐλεημοσύνη (eleēmosynē), meaning "mercy," "compassion," or "almsgiving." For instance, in Deuteronomy 6:25, where tsedaqah refers to righteousness through obedience to God’s commands, the LXX uses dikaiosynē. However, in later Jewish tradition and some contexts (e.g., Daniel 4:27 in the LXX), tsedaqah as charitable acts is translated as eleēmosynē.

[[The Bible Project\|The Bible Project]] - 
- When Adam and Eve choose to ignore God’s instruction and eat from the tree of knowing good and evil, it’s a choice to stop relating well with God. Immediately, a seismic shift occurs in the way that they relate to each other and everything around them. Listen to Adam’s response after God asks, “Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?” Adam says, “The woman whom you gave me, she gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it” ([Gen. 3:11-12](https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/3/), NET).
- When God turns to Eve, she similarly deflects blame toward the serpent. Suddenly, man and woman become preoccupied with self-preservation in a way that requires the subjugation of one another and the world around them. Previously, the humans walked in right relationship with each other and their Creator; now, they hide from him and respond dishonestly to his questions. Even worse, they begin to die because right relating is essential to ongoing life.
- The "[[Zunpublished/Law\|Law]] of Moses [[Gate of Wisdom/Torah\|Torah]] was intended to address humanity’s destructive craving—a deadly kind of hungering and thirsting. The daily practice of Moses’ law created rhythms of right relating with God and others that undermine self-centered ways of life. When people and whole communities follow these instructions, those routinely harmed or ignored by the power-hungry—the poor and powerless, widows and orphans—can find new life through the care shown to them by their neighbors.
- Jesus calls us to push aside our craving for personal gain and become like him. He promises that our hunger for this way of life will not leave us wanting: “How good is life for those who hunger and thirst for right relationships, _because they will be satisfied_” ([Matt. 5:6](https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/matthew/5/), BPT). Did you catch it? He’s saying that if we become hungry for right relating with others, we will eventually be satisfied. All of restored humanity will live in a flourishing world where no human being does harm or relates poorly to another.
