- Penalties/Consequence: Many commands lack specific penalties in Deuteronomy, with consequences often tied to the general curses of Deut. 28:15-68 or specific punishments like death (e.g., for idolatry, adultery, murder) or curses (Deut. 27). Some penalties are drawn from related Torah passages (e.g., Exodus, Leviticus).

#### It seems initially the Passover Lamb of the [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Passover Offering\|Passover Offering]] could be applied just as the Hebrews in Egypt applied the blood to their door posts. The emphasis is on seeking fellowship with God and gratitude for His redemption. This graphs one into the Congregation of Israel, becoming one of Yah-God's people, brought out of bondage and set free. Jesus became our Passover Lamb offering.

## Jesus as an Offering

- **Hebrews 10:26** **For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins**, 27 but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries. 28 A man who disregards Moses’ law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 29 **How much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God**, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know him who said, “Vengeance belongs to me. I will repay,” says the Lord. Again, “The Lord will judge his people.” 31 **It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God**
