### Heiser, Michael S.. [[Gate of Wisdom/Sources/Heiser, Michael S/The Unseen Realm\|The Unseen Realm]]The Unseen Realm: Recovering the Supernatural Worldview of the Bible (p. 171). Lexham Press. Kindle Edition.] 

Eli the priest later foolishly sent the ark of the covenant out to battle, and it fell into the hands of the Philistines, who took it to Ashdod and installed it in the temple of their god, Dagon. In a fascinating (and funny) incident of cosmic geography, Yahweh’s presence destroyed the statue of Dagon. First Samuel 5:5 describes the reaction of the Philistine priests: “Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who come into the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod until this very day.” This threshold was now Yahweh’s geography—they dared not walk on it.
