# Define
- At one point there was an uprising and some leaders wanted to know why Moses and Aaron had set themselves above the rest. So YHWH had them get 12 staffs, and write the name of the tribes on them. Levi’s staff had Aaron’s name written on it. They put them in the tent of the meeting in front of the Ark of the Witness and the staff that sprouted was the one YHWH picked. Aaron’s staff was the one that sprouted, budded, blossomed and produced almonds. They kept the staff as a sign of the rebellious.
