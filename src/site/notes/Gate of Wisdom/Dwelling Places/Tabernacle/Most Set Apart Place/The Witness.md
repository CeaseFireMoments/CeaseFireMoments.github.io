# Additional Info
I’ve come to realize there are three versions of “the commandments,” but only two are seen by Christianity. Both of those are actually man’s laws. 
	- **The Jewish law**. We know Jesus was not a fan of the commandments the Jewish religious leaders of His time were keeping. This is because they had added a bunch of their own laws. The Jewish Law was made up of the Torah laws PLUS their own Oral laws. They had a bunch of man made laws they followed, like don’t carry your mat or heal on the [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]].
	- **Jesus’s laws**. Love God and Love Your Neighbors. Christianity teaches we are no longer under the laws but under the blood. Some how that has translated to we don’t have to keep the laws of the Old Testament, which typically is tangled up in the Jewish laws. The Christian’s Laws are also man made because they went to the other side of the road. Theirs is Jesus MINUS the Torah laws. They said we don’t have to know the laws of the Torah, like keeping the Sabbath day.
	- **Jesus taught the [[Gate of Wisdom/Torah\|Torah]]** (part of the Jewish teaching) PLUS the Kingdom of Heaven is near (part of Christianity’s teaching). Jesus is the FULFILLMENT of everything in the Torah. He has taken the place of the Tabernacle, the High Priest, and the Sacrificial Lamb. He did not take the place of YHWH/God’s law. God’s law defines what is sinful.
