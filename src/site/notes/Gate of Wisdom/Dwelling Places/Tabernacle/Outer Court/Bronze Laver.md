# Define
- Kiyyor (כִּיּוֹר): The word "kiyyor" refers to a basin or laver, a wide, shallow vessel used for holding water. In the Tabernacle, it’s specifically the bronze container for ritual washing by the priests ([[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v18\|Exod-30:18-21]] [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v19\|Exod-30#v19]] [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v20\|Exod-30#v20]] [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v21\|Exod-30#v21]]). The Bible doesn’t define "kiyyor" explicitly, but its function is clear: it holds water for purification before entering the Tabernacle or offering sacrifices (Exodus 30:19-20, "for washing... so that they may not die"). [[Gate of Wisdom/Wash\|Wash]]
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Bronze\|Bronze]] Nechoshet (נְחֹשֶׁת): This term denotes the material of the laver and its base, translated as "bronze" or "copper" in English. In the Bible, nechumet is used for various Tabernacle items (e.g., altar in [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-27#v2\|Exod-27:2]]), indicating a durable, workable metal. The laver’s bronze came from mirrors ([[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-38#v8\|Exod-38:8]]), but no further etymological detail is provided.
- Ken (כֵּן): Refers to the stand or foundation of the laver, also made of bronze. The Bible doesn’t describe its shape or construction but indicates it supports the laver ([[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v18\|Exod-30:18]]). The term "ken" implies a pedestal or footing to hold the basin steady for use.
- Rachats (רָחַץ): This verb describes the laver’s purpose: the priests washed their hands and feet to cleanse themselves ritually (Exodus 30:19, "Aaron and his sons shall wash"). The action is tied to purification to avoid death when approaching God’s presence (Exodus 30:20-21).

## The Laver
God gave the Bronze Laver in the [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Tabernacle\|Tabernacle]] to wash clean their hands and feet.
- This washing was not merely physical but symbolized spiritual cleansing, as the priests needed to be pure to approach God’s presence.
- Being in right relationship and [[Gate of Wisdom/Clean\|Clean]] //[[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Righteous\|righteous]] //, they were now prepared to enter into the Holy Place [[Zunpublished/Set Apart Place\|Set Apart Place]].
	  - [[Gate of Wisdom/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] is described as a state of being “clean” before God, free from sin’s defilement, which the laver facilitated in the priestly service.
- There was a veil [[Zunpublished/Veil\|Veil]] between the [[Zunpublished/Outer Court\|Outer Court]]s and the Holy Place, only a [[Zunpublished/Priest\|Priest]] could pass through into the Holy Place.
- The bronze laver was made from the mirrors of the women serving at the entrance to the [[Zunpublished/Tent of Meeting\|Tent of Meeting]] ([[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-38#v8\|Exod-38:8]]). Mirrors in ancient times were associated with vanity, and their transformation into a tool for purification suggests a shift from self-focus to God-focused righteousness

Ancient manuscripts and archaeological evidence show that Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Canaanite , and Hittite religions used water purification in rituals, often with basins or vessels, similar to the bronze laver’s function. However, the laver’s precise placement between the altar of burnt offering [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Outer Court/Bronze Altar\|Bronze Altar]] and the [[Zunpublished/Tent of Meeting\|Tent of Meeting]] is unique compared to these setups. No non-biblical text or artifact describes a basin fixed in this transitional position within a linear, portable sanctuary like the [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Tabernacle\|Tabernacle]].

## [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Feast of Unleavened Bread\|Feast of Unleavened Bread]]
God commands [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]] to eat unleavened bread for seven days, from the 14th //[[Zunpublished/Fourteen\|Fourteen]]// to the 21st //[[Zunpublished/Twenty-one\|Twenty-one]]// day of the first //[[Zunpublished/One\|One]]// month ([[Zunpublished/Nisan\|Nisan]]), removing [[Zunpublished/Leaven\|Leaven]] from their homes to commemorate their hasty exodus from Egypt ([[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-12#v39\|Exod-12:39]]). The feast is reiterated in [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-13#v6\|Exod-13:6]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-13#v7\|-7]], emphasizing no leaven is to be seen among the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]]. 
[[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-16#v1\|Deut-16:1-8]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-16#v2\|Deut-16#v2]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-16#v3\|Deut-16#v3]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-16#v4\|Deut-16#v4]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-16#v5\|Deut-16#v5]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-16#v6\|Deut-16#v6]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-16#v7\|Deut-16#v7]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-16#v8\|Deut-16#v8]] connects the feast to the [[Zunpublished/Passover\|Passover]] sacrifice, eaten with [[Zunpublished/Unleavened Bread\|Unleavened Bread]], called the “bread of affliction.” The feast symbolizes deliverance, purity (leaven often represents sin or corruption), and separation from Egypt.

Both the laver and the feast involve purification, though in different ways. The laver ensures physical and ritual cleanliness for priests ([[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v18\|Exod-30:18-21]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v19\|Exod-30#v19]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v20\|Exod-30#v20]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v21\|-21]]), symbolizing holiness before God. The Feast of Unleavened Bread involves removing leaven, often interpreted as a symbol of sin or corruption. [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-12#v15\|Exod-12:15]] mandates removing leaven, suggesting a communal purification to honor God’s deliverance. While both emphasize purity, the laver’s role is priestly and ritual, while the feast’s is communal and symbolic, tied to the exodus event.

However, the Bible, does not make a direct connection between the bronze laver and the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

## God provided a way.

Before [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Jesus\|Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Jesus]] one came preparing a way, he was called John the Baptizer.
	 John called people to an immersion in the river as a baptism of repentance from sin, marking a turning away from [[Gate of Wisdom/Lawlessness\|Lawlessness]] ([[Gate of Wisdom/Sin\|Sin]]). This is referred to as John's Baptism.
At the Passover Meal, Jesus, as the Bread of Life, offered the unleavened bread as his body, in memory of himself.
	 The bread representing dying to lawlessness (sin). Jesus was buried on the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
	 They had always eaten the unleavened bread at the Passover Meal, but Jesus changed why, he said to eat it at the Passover Meal in remembrance of him.
	 At his death, the veil between the Outer Courts and the Holy Place was torn from top to bottom, into two pieces, he had prepared the way for whoever into the Holy Place.

God provided those who eat of the Bread of Life (Jesus), a way to live forever, free from leaven (sin).

He sacrificed his fleshly body and died to sin, once and for all. Those trusting (faith) and obeying him, have also crucified their body and are no longer captive to lawlessness (sin).
