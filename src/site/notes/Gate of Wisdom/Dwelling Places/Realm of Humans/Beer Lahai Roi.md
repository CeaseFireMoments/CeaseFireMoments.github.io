# Define
- The precise location of Beer-lahai-roi is unknown today, but it was a biblical well situated in the Negev Desert of ancient Canaan, between the locations of Kadesh and Bered. 
- While its exact site is not definitively identified, scholars suggest it was likely a real well near the modern-day locations of Ain Muweileh or Ain el-Qoseimeh in southern Israel or the Sinai Peninsula, west of Beersheba.
- Some suggest it is not in Negev as suggested by Genesis 24:62. Land of the South is the region of Negev.
