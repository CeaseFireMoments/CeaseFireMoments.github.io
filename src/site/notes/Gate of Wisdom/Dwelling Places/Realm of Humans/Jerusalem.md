- **Symbolic**: 
	- The city of God’s dwelling and chosen place (Deut 12:5, 11; 1 Kings 8:44, 48; Ps 132:13-14)
	- The throne of the Lord (Jer 3:17)
	- The holy city (Isa 48:2; 52:1; Neh 11:1)
	- Zion, the joy of the whole earth (Ps 48:2)
	- The “heavenly Jerusalem” (Heb 12:22; Gal 4:26) and ultimately the “new Jerusalem” coming down from heaven as the eternal dwelling place of God with His people (Rev 21:2-3)
- **Major Events**:
	- Abraham meets Melchizedek, king of Salem (Gen 14:18-20)
	- Abraham offers Isaac on Mount Moriah (traditionally identified as the Temple Mount area; Gen 22:2; 2 Chr 3:1)
	- David conquers the Jebusite city and makes it his capital, “the city of David” (2 Sam 5:6-10; 1 Chr 11:4-9)
	- David brings the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (2 Sam 6)
	- Solomon builds the First Temple (1 Kings 6–8; 2 Chr 3–7)
	- Dedication of the Temple; God’s glory fills it (1 Kings 8:10-11)
	- Destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple by Babylon (2 Kings 25; 2 Chr 36:17-21; Jer 52)
	- Return from exile and rebuilding of the Temple under Zerubbabel (Ezra 3–6)
	- Dedication of the walls by Nehemiah (Neh 12:27-43)
	- Jesus’ triumphal entry (Matt 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-44; John 12:12-19)
	- Cleansing of the Temple (Matt 21:12-13; John 2:13-17)
	- The Last Supper in Jerusalem (Mark 14:12-25)

	- The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost in Jerusalem (Acts 2)
	- The early church centered in Jerusalem (Acts 1–15)
	- Future prophetic events: Jerusalem as a “cup of trembling” and “burdensome stone” (Zech 12:2-3); surrounded by armies in the last days (Zech 14; Luke 21:20-24); the return of Christ to the Mount of Olives (Zech 14:4; Acts 1:11-12); the millennial reign with Jerusalem as capital (Isa 2:1-4; Zech 8:3; 14:16-17)

# Inhabitants of Jerusalem Chronologically

### Pre-Israelite / Canaanite period
- Genesis 14:18 – Inhabitants: Canaanites; city called **Salem**; ruled by **Melchizedek** (king-priest)
- Joshua 10:1-5; 15:63; Judges 1:21; 19:10-11 – City called **Jebus**; inhabited and ruled by **Jebusites** (a Canaanite people); Israelites could not drive them out

### United Monarchy (Israelite period)

- 1 Kings 1–11; 1 Chronicles 12 to 2 Chronicles 9 – **Solomon** reigns; Jerusalem is capital of the united twelve tribes
- 1 Kings 11:42–12:19 – Still inhabited by all Israel until the split

### Divided Kingdom – Capital of Judah only
- 1 Kings 12:20 to 2 Kings 25 (parallel 2 Chronicles 10–36)  
  Inhabitants: **Kingdom of Judah** (tribes of Judah, Benjamin, many Levites, plus some from other tribes who moved south)  
  Kings of the House of David reign in Jerusalem for ~390 years

### Babylonian conquest and exile

  Jerusalem besieged and destroyed (586 BC)

  Nehemiah 11 lists the repopulation: Judahites, Benjamites, priests, Levites, gatekeepers, etc.

### Intertestamental → New Testament period (up to AD 70)
- The Old Testament does not cover this period, but the New Testament assumes:
  - Luke 2:41-42; John 2:13; Acts 2 etc. – Jerusalem inhabited by **Jews** under Roman rule (Herod’s Temple standing)

### After the crucifixion and before AD 70
