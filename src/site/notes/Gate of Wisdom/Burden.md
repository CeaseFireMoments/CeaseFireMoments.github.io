# Define
- Hebrew: maśśāʾ (מַשָּׂא) A masculine noun meaning a load, burden (something carried or lifted); also tribute, porterage; figuratively an utterance/oracle (especially a prophetic pronouncement, often of doom).
	- Derived from the root verb nāśāʾ (נָשָׂא) to lift, carry, bear, take up, forgive (the idea of "lifting" something onto oneself, whether a physical load, sin, or responsibility).
	- **Nehemiah 13:15–19** uses the same word for loads of wine, grapes, figs, and other burdens brought in on the Sabbath
	- **Jer 17:21–22** — The term refers to literal loads carried through the city gates on the Sabbath. It is strictly concrete: do not lift, bring in, or carry loads.
- sēbel (סֵבֶל) – a load or forced labor (e.g., Exod 1:11; 1 Kgs 5:15).
- ʿōl (עֹל) – yoke/burden (e.g., Isa 10:27; Matt 11:30 in NT Greek parallel)

- Greek: the Septuagint translates massaʼ with forms of phortion (φορτίον) — “load,” “burden,” “something carried.” Same word appears in:
	- Matt 11:30 (“My burden is light
	- Acts 15:28 (“no greater burden than these requirements”)
	- Gal 6:5 (“each must bear his own load / phortion”)
