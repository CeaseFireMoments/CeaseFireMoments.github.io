# Define
- Hebrew: ḥaṭṭāʾt (חַטָּאת) sin, sin-offering; fundamentally means “missing the mark,” failing to meet God’s standard, going astray from the right path. It emphasizes the act of deviating from God’s will rather than deliberate rebellion.
	- Three major Hebrew sin-words
		- ḥaṭṭāʾt = “sin” – missing the mark
		- ʿāwōn = “iniquity” – crookedness, guilt, perversion
		- pesha = “[[Gate of Wisdom/Transgression\|Transgression]]/rebellion” – deliberate revolt

- Greek: 
	- Most common LXX rendering of חַטָּאת: ἁμαρτία (hamartia) – “sin, failure to hit the target” (the primary NT word for sin; used over 170 times).  
	- Other occasional equivalents: ἁμάρτημα (hamartēma) – “sin, sinful act.”
