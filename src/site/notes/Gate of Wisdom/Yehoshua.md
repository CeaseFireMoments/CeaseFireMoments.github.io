E ast of Eden is where Cain was expelled to. This is earth. Earth does not mean the big blue ball floating out in space. Earth is where man is.

  

E arth is where man’s law reigns.

  

W e are going to talk about the access to the [[Zunpublished/Outer Court\|Outer Court]] today. Outer Courts = East of Eden

M any people live in these outer courts. Confessing with their mouth but not with their lives. They continue to go back and forth between Outside and the Outer Courts.

  

T hese people had access to the Outer Courts. The only way they could enter is by coming to the gate with an offering.

  

## A Christian Walk with the Tabernacle Israelites

J ust from looking at the people, the way the camp and the tabernacle were set up, we can see God’s path to a relationship with him. It starts with Jesus, but Jesus is not the destination, he is the way to the destination. Over in the orange area, we are on Earth, the further we move toward the purple area, the close we get to Heaven. Heaven means the place where God Reigns. In this case, it isn’t a place, it is a state of being.

  

1. W e start out on the outside, the lost foreigner, gentile, living in our fleshly desires, All about our will being done.

  

1. Then we move to the outer Court Gate as a called out person. Just like the Tribes of Israel were brought out of bondate, God is calling us out of bondage out of our own wants.
2. As we answer that call, we come to the gate and are inspected. Jesus has stepped up to offer his blood as a covering so we can enter in with confidence. We are now a part of the Called out Group, we’ve been adopted as the chose people of YHWH. This is where we start to give up our old personalities, our old character, and our old way of life - we give God our heart and decide to love the Lord our God with all our hearts. But this isn’t where we stay.
3. We can move confidently into the Set-apart place and become part of the Called out Body of Christ, the royal priesthood, the set apart people. We give over our appetitles and our desires, our stubborn wills and Love the lord our God with all our soul or will and strength. As priests, we begin to teach other Gods ways and his right rullings.
4. Then we move into the most set-apart place with the Called out Life, we begin to dress and act differently as we function as the High Priests did as we move as one with our High Priest Jesus. We give over our minds to God. Our minds would be our thoughts and our feelings our habitual inclinations in life. We Love the Lord our God with all our mind.
5. As we move into this area, this is where the earthly and the heavenly overlap. It brings up to being a Called out being the Raised up ones it’s where our walking in the Spirit, thrown off the fleshly ways, and are about YHWH’s will being done. This is where the Garden of Eden was. It was a place where the flesh could walk and talk with God. This is what Jesus was talking about when he said The Kingdom of Heaven is near. If we heard someones say this today in our terms, it would sound more like God Reigns is near. All you have to do is answer his call and let God reign in your heart, your soul, will, and strength, and in your heart. Let God’s reign come,

  

The set up of the Tabernacle can show us just how close or far away we are in our relationship with God.

  

So where are you are in your walk?

  

## The Tabernacle

Let’s talk about Jesus and access to the Tabernacle.

1. Jesus has identified himself as our Passover Lamb. If you recall, in the Exodus Story the Lambs blood was put on the threshold of the homes so that death would passover them and not kill the first born in their home. There were no requirements on anyone in the household outside of participating in sacrificing the lamb. If they were in a house with blood on the threshold, they were passed over. Those people were then lead out of bondage and set free.
2. This is exactly what Jesus did, he provided his blood as the sacrificial lamb. That is made available to anyone and everyone. Those who want to enter the Kingdom of God come with their offering (Jesus) and they have access to the Kingdom. There is no access to the Kingdom without an offering.
3. The problem is, the people who only access the Outer Courts, keep coming back because again, they confess with their mouths, but do not change their old ways.
4. They agree to follow God’s law, and then turn right around and create an idol. In a previous video, I referred to these people as the MY way people.n a previous video, I referred to these people as the MY way people.
5. They participate in offering the passover land, they put the blood over their threshold. They are then lead out of bondage and set free, only to long for their bondage or return to the bondage. If you have not read Exodus, I encourage you to do so. There is very little you will see in the movies and animations created to try to tell the story.
6. At this time, Jesus had not fulfilled the passover lamb requirements, but God had other requirements for the Israelites to be able to enter the outer courts.
