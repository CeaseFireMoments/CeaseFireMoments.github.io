# Define
- Hebrew: bekorah, from bekor, meaning "firstborn" 
- A deep cultural, spiritual, and legal significance tied to family structure, divine promises, and inheritance.
-  It was a special privilege granted to the [[Zunpublished/Firstborn\|Firstborn]] son in a Hebrew family.
	- **Double Portion of Inheritance**: The firstborn received a double share of the father’s estate compared to other siblings (Deuteronomy 21:15-17). This ensured the firstborn’s ability to lead and provide for the family.
	- **Family Leadership**: The firstborn often assumed the role of family head after the father’s death, carrying responsibilities for the clan’s welfare and spiritual leadership.
	- **Covenantal Significance**: In the context of God’s promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the birthright would include inheriting the covenant blessings (e.g., land, descendants, and God’s favor; Genesis 12:1-3, 26:2-5, 28:13-15).
- Yah/God had ultimate authority to override human customs regarding birthrights and could redirect it based on His purposes, emphasizing divine election over strict human tradition.
- Could be forfeited, sold, or reassigned (e.g., Esau’s sale, Reuben’s loss).

# Additional Info
- Deuteronomy 21:15-17 explicitly protects the firstborn’s right to the double portion, even if the father favored another wife’s son. This law reflects the Hebrew mindset that the birthright was a sacred trust, not subject to personal whims.
- The firstborn’s role extended to spiritual duties, such as redeeming family members or property (Leviticus 25:25, Numbers 3:12-13) and leading in worship or covenant responsibilities. This underscores the birthright’s communal and spiritual weight.
- Honor and Shame: Despising or losing the birthright (e.g., Esau, Reuben) brought shame, as it signaled disregard for God’s order or moral failure. Conversely, receiving or honoring the birthright (e.g., Jacob, Joseph) aligned with divine favor.
