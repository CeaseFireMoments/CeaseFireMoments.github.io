The Dragon's Prophecy

J onathan Cahn 2024

  

### Cahn, Jonathan. The Dragon's Prophecy: Israel, the Dark Resurrection, an

  

## The Mystery of Evil - Chapter 3

E vil is a problem for the very reason that it was not created. It should not exist, because it was not created, and yet it does. The existence of evil defies the created order. It is not of the creation and thus exists in opposition to the created order. Evil exists in defiance of existence.

  

T hus in our search for an answer to evil, we are led to personhood.

  

E vil is an inversion—an inversion of truth, of reality, of existence. Evil is, by nature, inverted and, by nature, inverts.

  

I t has no true, ultimate, or absolute existence and therefore acts to bring that which exists into nonexistence. And so evil, by nature, seeks destruction. It opposes that which is.

  

T here are two entities with the ability to choose good or evil: one, human, and the other, angelic.

  

## The Enemy - Chapter 4

  

T he [Devil](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Devil?name=Devil) - // [Satan](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Satan?name=Satan) //

1. t he Prince of Darkness,
2. B eelzebul,
3. t he Father of Lies, d the End of Days. Charisma House. Kindle Edition.
4. “ He is a liar and the father of lies”
5. [L ucifer](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Lucifer?name=Lucifer), // I do not agree with this one//

8. T he Destroyer
9. “I will be like Most High”
10. “He was a murderer from the beginning”

  

Man is the center of God’s creation and bears God’s image. Therefore, the Enemy especially seeks man’s destruction. If he can destroy man, he can eradicate the image of God.

  

#### I don’t feel as though all instances of the word “Satan” is an adversary to YHWH. For example Job 1 and Job 2 and. Maybe the one in the Wilderness with Jesus in Matthew 4

  

## The Mystery People - Chapter 5

## A Kingdom of Priests

  

Israel was called into being to be a holy people, a kingdom of priests. A priest is a minister of God’s purposes. So Israel was to be a vessel of God, a central conduit and instrument for the fulfillment of His plans and purposes for the world. It came into the world for the sake of every other people and nation, that, in them, all nations would be blessed.

  

[Exodus 19](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Exodus19?name=Exodus%2019):5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.”

  

#### Exodus 12:38 - A mixed multitude

#### Exodus 12:43 - No foreigner BUT every slave BUT if a sojourn wants to keep the Passover he can be circumcised then HE SHALL BE AS A NATIVE OF THE LAND. V 49: There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you.

  

[Deuteronomy 7](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Deuteronomy7?name=Deuteronomy%207):6 “For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has **chosen** you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.

  

#### When talking about the Exodus, we are not talking about only Jews or Jewish People. We are talking about the time of the Exodus. At that time all the tribes of Jacob/Israel were together along with foreigners who were traveling with them. - Deuteronomy 1 - ALL of Israel - includse Caleb who is not a native born Israelite.

  

## The Anti-Semitic Angel - Chapter 6

  

As the name Satan means the Opposer, it was inevitable that the Jews would become the most opposed people on earth. Those who had been called to occupy the focal point of God’s purposes on earth would inevitably occupy the focal point as well of the Enemy’s fury.

  

The truth is, the first of all anti-Semites was an angel.

  

And war broke out in heaven, Michael and his angels making war against the dragon.<sup>[f</sup>\] The [dragon](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Dragon?name=Dragon) and his angels fought,
{ #8}

{ #but}
 they were not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.
{ #9}

{ #And}
 the great [dragon](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Dragon?name=Dragon) was thrown down—the ancient serpent, called the [devil](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Devil?name=Devil) and [satan](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Satan?name=Satan), who deceives the whole world.<sup>[g</sup>\] He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. ^\[h\]
{ #10}

{ #Then}
 I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Anointed One, for the accuser of our brothers and sisters—the one who accuses them before our God day and night <sup>[i]</sup> —has been thrown out. [Revelation 12](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Revelation12?name=Revelation%2012):10

  

#### Who are the brothers and sisters in Revelation 12? 1 John 3 seems to have been written to believers?

#### Azazel was the leader of the rebellion in Genesis 6 - is this the one thrown down?

#### Lucifer is not a Proper name. More notes under Lucifer

  

## The Red Dragon Prophecy - Chapter 7

[Revelation 12](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Revelation12?name=Revelation%2012):1; [Genesis 37](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Genesis37?name=Genesis%2037) - The Woman = Israel The woman is not the church - the church did not give birth to Jesus

[Revelation 12](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Revelation12?name=Revelation%2012):3; Genesis 1 - Red [Dragon](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Dragon?name=Dragon) = Serpent of Old, Devil/Satan

Revelation 12:5; - The Child = Jesus. Israel was called to bring forth the Word, the revelation, the presence, and the knowledge of God to the world.

  

#### Is Genesis 3 - Eve vs the Serpant a foreshadowing of this?

## Days of the Vision - Chapter 8

  

So the vision’s fulfillment requires that the Jewish people return to their ancient homeland, Israel. That this has now actually happened as prophesied in the Bible, the door has been opened for the final act in the war of the Dragon and the woman.

  

## Dry Bones Rising - Chapter 9

The children of Israel never died as a people. But the polity, state, or kingdom that embodied it in ancient times was destroyed and, in that sense, died. But Ezekiel’s vision foretold its rising—another impossibility.

  

In the midst of Ezekiel’s vision the Lord had asked the prophet, “Can these bones live?”5 On May 14, 1948, the question was answered. The dry bones had risen from the valley of death. The nation of Israel was resurrected from the dead.

  

The new Israelites bore the resurrected names of the ancient Israelites who had inhabited the land thousands of years before.

  

And even the nation’s name, Israel, was part of the resurrection, having been borne thousands of years before by its ancient counterpart.

  

  

## The Mimic - Chapter 10

  

The prophet Isaiah describes the fall of the one called [Lucifer](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Lucifer?name=Lucifer)

  

## The Dragon’s Resurrection - Chapter 11

God. In the Book of Revelation the Dragon gives authority and power to the one called “the Beast,” also known as “the Antichrist,” or the Anti-Messiah.

  

In the original Greek the word Antichrist signifies not only one who is against, opposed to, and the antithesis of the Messiah, but one who is His substitute, His alternative, one who would take His place. So the Antichrist will mimic the Messiah in order to nullify Him.

  

## The Sea Peoples - Chapter 12

OF ALL THE enemies faced by Israel in ancient times, the one most deserving of the title archenemy was the people known as the Philistines.

  

In their first known appearance in ancient inscriptions, they are listed as one of those known as the Sea Peoples.

  

Egyptian inscriptions call one of the invading Sea Peoples the Pulasti, or the people of Peleset, or Palusata.

  

In Hebrew they are called the Pileshtim, the plural of the word Pilishti, a dweller of the region called Pilashet. It is believed that from the Hebrew Pileshtim came the Greek word Philistinoi. And from the Greek name came the Latin Philistinus, and from the Latin, the English word Philistine.

  

When King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded the land of Israel in the late seventh and early sixth centuries BC and, in the process, destroyed the cities of Philistia, it spelled the beginning of the end of the Philistines.7 They would soon vanish from the records of history, thereafter existing as a memory of a vanished people.

  

## The Anti-Land, Chapter 13

The land of Israel would now bear the name of the enemy of Israel—the Philistines. It would be the Roman version of the name that had once denoted Israel’s southwestern coast, the region once occupied by the Sea Peoples. But now the entire land of Israel, the Holy Land, was to be renamed the land of the Philistines.

  

In the Hebrew Scriptures the coastal strip was called the land of the Pilishtim, or Pilashet. Translated into other languages, the basic root p-l-s-t remained. In Greek it became the word Palaistine, and in Latin, Palaestina. In English it was rendered Palestine.

  

## The Filastin - Chapter 14

Since Filastin is the actual word used by the people known as the Palestinians, it will be used throughout this book.

  

## Metamorphosis - Chapter 15

  

The Arabs of the coastal strip were no longer under Egyptian rule; those in the north, no longer under Syrian rule; and those in the West Bank, no longer under Jordanian rule. And so the return of the Jewish people to Jerusalem inadvertently opened the door for a new identity to take possession of the Arab inhabitants of the land—that of the Palestinian.

  

God had given a promise to Israel concerning the land. He said: I will set your boundaries from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the River.9

  

## Pilashet - Chapter 16

The Gaza Strip was the land of the Philistines. By a quirk of history, the birth of Israel had led to a convergence of Arab inhabitants onto the same soil on which the ancient Philistines had once dwelt.

  

## The Anciet Hatred - Chapter 17

In defining the Philistines, one Bible commentator writes, Because the Philistines were a warlike and aggressive people, it was feared that Israel might be alarmed at meeting them.2 Another writes: By the time of the Exodus, the Philistines were known for their savage, warlike nature.3

  

## Children of Wrath - Chapter 18

And Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”1 The Hebrew word used for David’s youth is na’ar. It speaks of a child, a boy, from infancy to adolescence. The word used for Goliath’s youth is na’ur, derived from the same word, na’ar, and meaning the same.

  

As Goliath was a “man of war” from his childhood, a child soldier, so of the modern Filastin children it is written: Palestinian children know they are expected to be child soldiers.

  

## The Missiles - Chapter 19

PROMINENT AMONG THE Philistine warriors were the archers.

  

The archers allowed the Philistines to inflict deadly blows on the Israelites from a distance.

  

What is a missile? It is defined as this: An object which is forcibly propelled at a target, either by hand or from a mechanical weapon.5 The definition of an arrow is this: A missile shot from a bow and usually having a slender shaft, a pointed head…6

  

## The Kelah - Chapter 20

So it is written: So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him.1

  

kelah, the Hebrew word for a hanging and in this case referring to a sling.2

  

## Wars of Iron - Chapter 21

The Bible records: Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.”2

  

David’s victories would bring much-needed supplies of iron ore to his nation. Iron would now be used to Israel’s advantage, to withstand the attacks of the Philistines and to overcome them. So too in the modern wars of the resurrected Philistines and Israelites, iron would again play a central role—not only in the iron and steel weapons of Hamas but in Israel’s response to them.

  

## The Cauldron - Chapter 22

  

## The Predator - Chapter 23

IT IS IN the very first pages of the Bible that the Enemy is personified as a serpent. In the very last pages of the Bible he is actually called the “Serpent.”1 In the letter of 1 Peter he is spoken of as a “roaring lion.”2 In Revelation 12 he is called the “Dragon.”3 And one can find, in the scriptures referring to wolves, another allusion to his nature.

  

## The Prey - Chapter 24

So it is written of King Rehoboam: He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them.

  

## The Invaders - Chapter 25

King Jehoram of Judah was an evil monarch. He led the nation away from the ways of God.

  

## Ghosts of the Shephelah - Chapter 26

2 Chronicles 28: The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt there.

  

Those nearest to, bordering, and just east and inland of Philistia—and those towns, cities, and villages of the Shephelah and the Negev. Note the last region to be mentioned is Gaza with its towns and villages. What would this correspond with? The Gaza Strip.

  

It was on that same ground, most vulnerable to the ancient Philistine invaders, that the Israeli youths gathered to take part in their music festival when the invaders from Gaza turned their celebration into calamity.6And it was that same ground on which stood the villages, kibbutzes, and homes of Israeli families that would be devastated on October 7.

  

## The Captives - Chapter 27

And they came up into Judah and invaded it, and carried away…his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

  

What happened at King Jehoram’s house was not an exception. It was the common practice of the Philistines to take Israeli captives from the lands and dwellings they invaded.

  

What was the purpose of taking civilians captive? The invaders could turn the captives into slaves or sell them into slavery to others. The captives could be used as bargaining chips, as security or leverage to force or stay the hand of an opposing power. And they could be taken captive simply as an act of dominance, vengeance, brutality, and rage.

  

  

## The Reptilian - Chapter 28

## The Terrors - Chapter 29

IN EZEKIEL 32 the prophet gives a unique glimpse into the fate of those nations that warred against the ways of God. “Who Caused Terror in the Land of the Living”

  

theme. Of the Assyrians it is written that they caused terror in the land of the living.1 Of the Elamites, they caused their terror in the land of the living.2 Of Meshech and Tubal, they caused their terror in the land of the living.3 And of the Sidonians, they will go down in shame at the terror which they caused by their might.4 What they all hold in common is terror.

  

The word translated as terror is the Hebrew khitit. It comes from the root word khatat, which means to break down as by violence or confusion, or by instilling fear, by terrifying. Israel’s ancient enemies brought terror to the land.

  

## The Pits - Chapter 30

When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger (for the people were distressed), then the people hid in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in holes, and in pits.

  

garrison. Jonathan and his armor bearer appear before the soldiers of the Philistine fortress: And the Philistines said, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden.”

  

## The Act of Galah - Chapter 31

THE LORD GAVE the prophet Isaiah a strange command: “Go, and remove the sackcloth from your body, and take your sandals off your feet.” And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.1

  

But it was a prophetic act: Then the LORD said, “Just as My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder against Egypt and Ethiopia, so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians as prisoners and the Ethiopians as captives, young and old, naked and barefoot.”2

  

Behind the words carried away captive is the Hebrew word galah. The word can rightly be translated as to take captive, but its meaning goes deeper. It literally means to uncover, to unclothe, to denude, to strip naked. So the same Hebrew word meaning to take captive also means to strip naked.

  

## Specters of Gilboa - Chapter 32

The Bible records, They found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines, to proclaim it in the temple of their idols and among the people. Then they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.1

  

But now, at Mount Gilboa, the tables were turned. As a soldier of King Saul had cut off the head of a Philistine warrior, now Philistine warriors cut off the head of King Saul.

  

What then happened to the head of King Saul? The answer is found in the Book of 1 Chronicles: \[The Philistines\] took his head and his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines.… They…fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

  

## The Dragon’s Fingerprints - Chapter 33

The prophet Elisha reproved one of Israel’s ancient adversaries for the barbarities he would commit against the people of Israel: I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: Their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword; and you will dash their children…

  

## The Dark Matrix - Chapter 34

What happened on October 7 and its connection to the Philistines and the city of Gaza go back to an ancient event predating the Hamas invasion by over three thousand years. It centers on an Israelite named Sunshine, or Shimshon. We call him Samson.

  

## The Shimshon Prototype - Chapter 35

## The Prisoner - Chapter 36

The Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza.

  

The Hebrew words in the account of Samson’s captivity translated as prison are beit ha-asorim.2 It literally means the place of captivity, the house of the captives, or the place of the bound.

  

Cahn, Jonathan. The Dragon's Prophecy: Israel, the Dark Resurrection, and the End of Days (p. 102). Charisma House. Kindle Edition.

  

## The Spectacle - Chapter 37

Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice. And they said: “Our god has delivered into our hands Samson our enemy!”

  

## The Return of the Gazans - Chapter 38

So they called for Samson from the prison, and he performed for them. And they stationed him between the pillars. Then Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars which support the temple, so that I can lean on them.”

  

The Philistines and their leaders had gathered together to celebrate and give thanks to their god Dagon. Samson would bring calamity to Gaza on the day of its celebration. So on October 7, when the Gazans brought calamity to Israel, they would, likewise, do so on Israel’s day of celebration, when the people were celebrating a festival and giving thanks to God.

  

On October 7 it would all be reversed. The resurrected Philistines of Gaza would bring calamity to Israel on a Jewish holiday in which Israel was to rejoice. In fact the very name of the holiday, Simchat Torah, comes from the exact same word used to describe the Philistines in the account of Samson—simcha. So the vengeance of the Philistines would come upon Israel, likewise, on the day of simcha.

  

October 7 was both a holiday of rejoicing, Simchat Torah, and a holy day known as Shemini Atzeret. Shemini Atzeret is unique among Hebrew holidays in that it ordained that a single sacrifice be offered to God. So as did Samson to Gaza, now Gaza brought calamity to Israel, likewise, on a festival day on which a single sacrifice was to be offered.

  

## The Mufti - Chapter 39

The Mufti was an early admirer of Adolf Hitler. In 1933, shortly after Hitler’s rise to power in Germany, the Mufti expressed his support for the new government, stating that the Palestinian Muslims were enthusiastic supporters of the Nazi regime and looked forward to the spread of fascism throughout the Middle East.

  

In 1940 the Mufti drafted a document he hoped the Nazi government would approve in which the Arab countries would be given the right to solve the Jewish issue in their lands as the Nazis had solved it in Germany. In November 1941 the Mufti obtained a meeting with Hitler in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. He told Hitler that the Arabs were his natural allies, as they had the same enemies, most specifically the Jews. He asked Hitler to commit to the elimination of a national Jewish homeland. Hitler affirmed his commitment to destroying the Jewish element residing in the Arab sphere at the right time.5 The Holocaust was to be taken to the land of Israel.

  

Al-Husseini was increasingly drawn to Hitler’s SS, the prime agents of the Holocaust, and to Heinrich Himmler, its prime overseer. The German diplomat Fritz Grobba recorded that in July 1942 the Mufti visited a Nazi concentration camp and was favorably impressed. Throughout the Holocaust the Mufti would work tirelessly to block the routes of Jewish people trying to escape its horrors. He was personally responsible for preventing the escape of five hundred Jewish children, consigning them to their deaths in the Arbe concentration camp.

  

During the war al-Husseini worked for the Third Reich, broadcasting Nazi propaganda throughout the Arab world. The Nazis, in turn, took up the task of distributing his writings, including a pamphlet he wrote for the SS calling for the total destruction of the Jewish people. He implored his Nazi employers to bomb Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in order to kill the Jews residing in those cities. He worked with Himmler to organize Muslim SS killing squads in the Balkans.7 He publicly exhorted the Muslim world to follow the example of the Nazis in a “definitive solution to the Jewish problem.”8 He had hoped for a Nazi victory in the Middle East by which the Holocaust could reach the land of Israel. Near the end of the war the Mufti broadcast from Radio Berlin, “Arabs…kill the Jews wherever you find them.”9 Accused of having committed war crimes, the Mufti would again escape prosecution by fleeing to Egypt, where, upon his arrival, he was given a hero’s welcome. During his time with the Nazis his popularity among the Arabs had only increased. He resumed his leadership in the Arab world and worked extensively with the Muslim Brotherhood. At the time of Israel’s resurrection in 1948 he actively worked for its destruction.

  

The end of the Second World War saw the demise of Hitler and the leaders of the Third Reich. But the Mufti survived and remained an active agent of Nazi anti-Semitism throughout the Arab world. One prominent Muslim leader at the time proclaimed, “Germany and Hitler are gone, but al-Husseini will continue the struggle.”

  

In 1946, the year after the Holocaust’s end, after the Mufti fled from Germany and Europe to Egypt, he met an Arab teenager attending a secondary school in Cairo. He took the teenager under his wing and recruited him to his cause. The youth became his disciple. His name was Yasser Arafat.14 The Mufti indoctrinated Arafat and his associates into his hatred of the Jewish people and his ideology of extermination. So Yasser Arafat was taught and discipled by the man who worked with and for Adolf Hitler. Arafat would take al-Husseini’s mantle. He would become the leader and face of Palestinian nationalism and Palestinian terrorism. He too would be critical in the Philistine resurrection, taking up where al-Husseini left off.

  

## Child of the Brotherhood - Chapter 40

HASSAN AL-BANNA WAS born in 1906 in a rural Nile Delta town northwest of Cairo.1 He too would play a key role in the mystery.

  

The Muslim Brotherhood was born at the same time that another movement was coming to power, Nazism.

  

From 1935 onward the Brotherhood would send delegations to attend the Nazi party’s annual rallies in Nuremberg. Along with other anti-Semitic writings from the West, the Brotherhood translated Hitler’s autobiography and diatribe against the Jews into Arabic. As for its title, Mein Kampf (“My Struggle”), they rendered it as My Jihad. It would become widely published throughout the Arab and Islamic worlds. Beginning in the 1930s Hitler financed the Brotherhood. Brotherhood members, in turn, functioned as Middle Eastern Nazi spies. The Nazis would also help the Muslim Brotherhood in its organizing, its dissemination of propaganda, and its waging of war.

  

The Brotherhood would give birth to the Islamic Resistance Movement. In Arabic it was called Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya.7 The name was shortened into an acronym. The Brotherhood’s child was given the name Hamas.

  

## The Madman’s Charter - Chapter 41

  

Hamas charter “Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it.

  

For our struggle against the Jew is extremely wide ranging and grave.

  

Hitler used same words, “my struggle,” as the name of his autobiography. Much of the Hamas’ charter reads like Nai propaganda and could have been written by Adolf Hitler.

  

## The Dark Places of the Earth - Chapter 42

HAmas acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement - it is also an ancient Middle Eastern word.

  

In Arabic, Hamas means zeal, strength, passio, and bravery.

  

In Hebrew, Hamas means violence, evil, and destruction. In scripture it referes to brutality, immorality, falsehood, lawlessness, injustice, and acts of cruelty, plunder, murder, slaughter, and terror.

  

Psalms 140 - Preserve me from the men of hamas.

  

For hamas against your brother Jacob, shame shall cover you, and you will be cut off forever.

  

Psalms 74 the dark places of the earth are full of the dwellings of hamas.

  

Ezekiel - Hamas has risen up into a rod of wickedness.

  

For the land is filled with crimes of blood and the city is full of hamas.

  

Jeremiah - judgment of Babylon - Let the hamas done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon. (In the preceding verse is the word Tannin- Dragon.

  

Isaiah 60 - Hamas shall no longer be heard in your land, neither wasting nor destruction within you borders.

  

## Fire on the Walls - Chapter 43

  

Amos - Because she took captive whole communities, I will send fire on the wals of Gaza that will consume her fortresses.

  

  

## Swords of Iron - Chapter 44

Ezekiel - Put an end to hamas, put away hamas, remove hamas, get rid of hamas.

  

Iron dome, iron wall, iron beam, iron sting - iron, the element so critical in the ancient wars of Israel and Philistia again took center stage in the wards of their modern counterparts.

  

## The Dragon’s Flood - Chapter 45

Revelation 12 - spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.

  

Flood - potamon - river, torrent, deluge, or flood.

  

The name given to the October 7 invasion was given the name Tufan - Tufan meansdeluge, inundation, overlfow, cataclysm, flood.

  

## The Unholy Days - The Desecrator - Chapter 46

The dragon is a desecrator and the father of abomonations.

  

The enemy desecrates the holy by creating an inverted imitation - lies in imitation of truth, false gods in imitation of God, and the darkness of the occult in imitation of the powers of the Spirit.

  

“Satan worship” is based on the worship of God. The Calendar of God consist of Holy days, so the enemy has his own calendar of unholy days, feasts, and convocations, his sacred days of desecration.

  

## The Black Sabbath - Chapter 47

It was the seventh day that sealed God’s creation. Shabbat / Sabbath

  

A sign of the nation’s covenant with God. A celebration of life, of peace, renewal, and restoration.

  

It was to be received, not just observed. Welcomed into the home as if it were a royal guest.

  

The attack broke the laws of tzod which forbade any trapping or foced confiment on the Sabbath.

  

The laws of koshair which forbade the binding togtether of two objects.

  

The laws of hotzaah - forbade the transferring of any object on the Sabbath day from one domain to another. To take an object from a private domain to a public space or from a public space into a private doman.

  

The laws of mavir - any form of igniting aand kindling, the setting, fueling, or spreading of fires.

Death - Fourth Housreman - And the name of him who sat on it was Death and Hades followed with him.

  

Have become known as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

  

Tallit - Jewish prayer shaw - white cloth framed with stripes, ideally of blue. A take on the tassle - [tzitzit](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Tzitzit?name=Tzitzit).

The four horses of the apocalypse ([horsemen](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Horsemen?name=Horsemen)) is called huppos leukos in Greek. Leukos word for light. Means white.

  

## The Frogs - Chapter 54

[Revelation 16](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Revelation16?name=Revelation%2016) - And I saw three unclean spirits like [frogs](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Frog?name=Frog) coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the [false prophet](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/FalseProphet?name=False%20Prophet).

  

The goal of the spirites is to draw the world into the Drago’s will and into waging war against Israel.

  

## Ezekiel’s Raiders - Chapter 55

[Ezekiel 38](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Ezekiel38?name=Ezekiel%2038) and [Ezekiel 39](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Ezekiel39?name=Ezekiel%2039) - many believe it foretells the next major prophetic event.

  

There are many other elements that place its fulfillment firmly at the end of the age.

  

There is not evidence of what was foretold having been fulfilled in ancient times. It exclusively concerns nations that do not border the land of Israel, several of which are a considerably distance from the other. Many take this as being figuratively rather than literal.

  

After many days you will be visited. In the latter years you will come nto the land of those brought back from the sword and gathered from many people on the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate; they were brought out of the nations, and now all of them dwell safely.

  

The prophecy is for many days, a biblical way of denoting ages. It is apponted for the latter years - a phrase that specifically denotes the end of the age. The land of Israel is referred to as that which has been brought back from the sword and gathered from many people. In modern times the land of Israel has lain desolate for nearly two thousand years.

  

The prophecy foretells a coordinated attack of enemy nations against the resurrect Israel a mass invastion. The invating nations will say:

  

I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will go to a peaceful people, who dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls... against the waste places that are again inhabited ad against a people gathered from the nations.

  

This description matches modern Israel.

  

Natios given in prophecy are

God, Magog, Meshekah, Tubal = Turkey provided funds to arm Hamas

Paras = Iran supported and armed Hamas - the shadow behind it all.

Kush = Sudan invaded Israel by proxy

Phut = Puta, Putaya, liked to Lubim, Libya made possible the thousands of rockets

Gomer, and

Togarmah.

  

Rosh - be we do not know if it is a proper name denoting a nation or simply the Hebrew word signifying head or chieve, we will focus on those we are sure of.

  

The prophecy’s fulfillment is still to come.

  

## The Sar Paras - Chapter 56

The war broke out in heaven - Revelation 12

  

Daniel received prophecies concerning the end of days.

  

Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words. But the \[Sar Malkhut Paras\] withstood me twenty-one days.

  

The entity is identified in Hebrew as the Sar Malkhut Paras. The word sar can be translated as prince, head, chief, ruler, captain, keeper, steward, lord, or master. The word malkhut means kingdom. And the word Paras, as it appeared in Ezekiel 38, means Persia.

  

It was an angel of darkness - a demonic entity.

  

The Sar Paras war against the purposes of God - seeks to stop them before their fulfillment, to thwart the purposes of God concerning Israel.

  

Michael - Me-kha-el a chief prince. The great prince who stand for the childen of your people. Behind the word prince is the HEbrew word sar - the same Hebrew word in Sar Paras. Michael is Sar Yisrael - Prince of Israel -

In Daniel - a time, times, and half a time...

  

Revelation 13 forty-two months - 3.5 years

  

time = 1 year, times = 2 years, half a time = 6 months

Revelation 11 - the temple given over to enemeies for forty two months

  

Daniel 9 - the middle of the week. Shavuah = week. span of time marked by the number seven - in this case seven years. This has come to be known as the Tribulation Period, the last seven years leading up to Messiah’s return. The middle of the week - seven divided by two, comes out to three and a half years.

every true follower of Messiah is by the Spirit a child of Abraham adopted into God’s household and spiritually Jewish. Likewise, the faith known to the world as Christianity was born of a Jewish womb, of the matrix of Isreal.

  

## The End of Days Reunion - Chapter 67

Two Kingdoms, One Lamb, and One Dragon In Revelation the Dragon and the Beast wage war against the Lamb. There are two entities on earth that are joined to the Lamb—the church and Israel. The church is joined to the Lamb in spirit and as He is its Savior and Redeemer. Israel is joined to Him in flesh and blood and as He is the Messiah of Israel, King of the Jews. One represents Him in spirit, and the other in flesh and blood. And so the Dragon wages war against them both. They are two sides of the same war, the Dragon and the Lamb. Both Israel and the church are essential for the coming of God’s kingdom on earth. If the church fulfills its mission in the world, and Israel its purposes in the land, the kingdom will come. So the Dragon will war to keep the church from its mission and Israel from its purposes. He will seek to marginalize and alienate Israel from the nations and the church from society. He will seek the delegitimization of each. He will challenge their right to exist. He will stir up hostility against the church and rage against Israel. He will attempt the spiritual destruction of the church and the physical destruction of Israel. The nations will, in turn, persecute the followers of Messiah and seek Israel’s annihilation.

  

The closer we come to the end of days, the more important it will be for the two peoples of Messiah to stand as one. The coming together has already begun. That Israel’s greatest friends are those who follow the Messiah, Yeshua, and who are known as Christians is more evident now than it has ever been. As for the church, it has increasingly been moving to the reclamation of its biblical roots and its Jewish heritage as it turns increasingly from Rome to Jerusalem. The Dragon’s rage against each will accelerate their reunion. For each was destined in the end to be rejoined to the other—just as each will be joined as the focal point of the Dragon’s fury—in his rage against the woman and his war against the rest of her children.

  

## The Return to the Beginning - Chapter 68

If Israel and the church are intrinsically joined, if one corresponds to the other, then would not the return and resurrection of Israel point to a corresponding return and resurrection of the church? If, at the end of the age, the Jewish people have returned to where they were at the beginning of the age, to Israel, then would it not also be the time for the followers of Messiah to return to where they were at the beginning of the age? And where were they at the beginning of the age? They were in the Book of Acts. It is time to return to the Book of Acts.

  

From the Status Quo to the Revolutionary For the Jewish people to return to Israel meant laying aside an identity they had acquired in their two thousand years of statelessness and wandering. It meant the taking up and restoring of the identity from which they had been long separated. The church, the followers of Messiah, must do likewise. They must lay aside the identity they had acquired in ages of being joined to the world and to the status quo. They must take up the identity they had possessed at the beginning. The force of persecution will not hinder that process—it will accelerate it. As the Jewish people had to repossess their ancient inheritance, the church must likewise repossess its ancient inheritance in the Book of Acts. In other words, the Christian faith must move away from its union with the world and become once again a radical entity. It must once again don its revolutionary and world-changing mantle.

  

The Forgotten Calling Just as the Jewish people who returned to Israel were charged with reviving a long-dead land, so too each end-time believer is to revive the long-lost life and power of the Book of Acts. Each must walk the long-unwalked ways of those who, at the dawn of the age, transformed the world. The believers of the end must take up the mantle of the beginning. They must choose to live as they lived, not of worldly power, but by the power of the Spirit. They must stand as did the first believers, in faith, hope, courage, and victory, and not be overcome by the world but, by the power of God, overcome it.

  

## The Mystery of the Secret Israelis - Chapter 69

You were without the Messiah, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants of the promise.…So then you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens.

## The Dragon Slayer - Chapter 70

Messiah is also called the Shepherd of Israel. What then happens if a flock is separated from its shepherd? That flock will be scattered and become defenseless against its predators. And so if Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah, He is the Shepherd of Israel. And if the children of Israel are separated from Him, they will become as sheep without a shepherd. They will scatter and wander the earth and become defenseless, as prey to the predators of the world.

  

In the last two thousand years, when one nation or power has come against the Jewish people, there was always another refuge, nation, or hope on the horizon. But in the end, when all nations come against them, there will be no such refuge or hope. And so it will be then that He will come. Messiah will return. The flock of Israel will return to their Shepherd and will be saved by His hand. And the kingdom will come, and its name will be Israel, and its King will be Messiah.

  

## The Mystery’s Answer - Chapter 71

What is the antidote to the Dragon and the answer to his war against our lives? It is the same answer to his war against Israel—Messiah. For the Shepherd of Israel is also the Shepherd of souls, Yeshua, Jesus, whose very name signifies not only the salvation of all—but the salvation of each. And as the power of the Enemy lies in the separating of all and each from God, so the power of Messiah is manifest in the ending of that separation and the bringing back of each and all to God. That separation can be ended only in the ending of evil, the nullifying of sin. And it is only in the Lamb, in His sacrifice, that evil can be ended and sins wiped away. Only in the Lamb can our separation from God be undone and the works of the Dragon be destroyed.

  

## Nikao - Chapter 72

Revelation 12 - overcome - Nikao is the greek word meaning also to conquer, to subdue, to triumph, to win the victory. It’s written in the past tense. in the past tense and yet to come.

  

It is only the Lamb that can overcome the Dragon. Without the Lamb we are subject to the Dragon’s rule and cannot overcome the power of evil, of darkness, or sin. But in the Lamb we are given the power to overcome the Dragon. The nikao is with the Lamb. It is the Lamb who will be victorious, and those who follow Him who will likewise become so in the end.
