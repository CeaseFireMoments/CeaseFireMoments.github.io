# [Gen 44:18-46:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2044%3A18-46%3A27&version=WEB;TLV;OJB)

#### My Notes 
- he has made me a father to Pharaoh
- live as foreigners in the land
- Jacob blessed Pharaoh
- When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan ... Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone
- Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh ... Only he didn't buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn't sell their land. It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh
