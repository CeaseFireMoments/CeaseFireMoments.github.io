# God’s sovereign deliverance of His covenant people
# [Gen 39:1-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2039%3A1-30&version=WEB;TLV;OJB) Joseph in Egypt (sold as a slave, falsely accused, imprisoned)

#### My Notes
- [Genesis 03](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&version=TLV;OJB) language:
	- "set her eyes on Joseph"
		- "Now the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a thing of lust for the eyes, and that the tree was desirable" Gen-03:6 
	- "Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us.
		- She said Potiphar brought the Hebrew in to mock her and her house men.
		- She shifted blame and inflame ethnic resentment against Joseph.
		- The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me
			- The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it. [Gen-03:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Genesis%203%3A12)
- "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God."
		- [[Zunpublished/Joseph\|Joseph]] was concerned with what YHWH thought, not with what Potiphar thought. 
		- Joseph didn't take what the woman offered he stayed [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Righteous\|Righteous]] in the eyes of YHWH, unlike [[Adam\|Adam]] 
- [Genesis 02](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202&version=TLV;OJB) language:
	- "Joseph's master //Potiphar// took him, and put him into the prison," 
		- "Elohim took the adam and put him in the Gan Eden"
- Yahweh was with him ... made all that he did prosper
	- Potipher
		- saw that Yahweh was with him,
		- all that he had he put into his hand
		- He didn't concern himself with anything
	- The keeper of the prison
		- in the sight of the keeper of the prison
		- committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners
		- The keeper of the prison didn't look after anything
# [Isaiah 37:31-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2037%3A31-37&version=WEB;TLV;OJB) (with parallel 2 Kings 19:31–37) → Hezekiah and Jerusalem delivered from Assyria
#### My Notes
- The jealousy/zeal of YHWH of Armies
	- Zeal qānā (קָנָא) Jealousy (in the sense of exclusive claim or protective passion): Ex 20:5; 34:14; Deut 4:24; Josh 24:19; Nah 1:2. 
	- Literally "hosts" or "armies" In the Hebrew Bible this is the most common divine title after YHWH itself (appears ~285 times)
		- Isaiah 9:7 (Heb 9:6) — the zeal of YHWH of Hosts will establish David’s throne forever (speaking of Messiah)
	- It is not human effort, not Hezekiah’s army, not even angelic armies acting independently, but the personal, fiery zeal of the sovereign Commander of all heavenly and earthly forces
- 'For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.'" 
	- For YHWH's sake
	- and for David's sake

# [Acts 7:9-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207%3A9-37&version=WEB;TLV;OJB) Stephen’s leap to Moses
#### My Notes
- Stephen, in his speech before the Sanhedrin, explicitly ties Joseph and the exodus deliverance together and uses the exact same wording and pattern that Isaiah 37 uses.
- Stephen is preaching the same God who was with Joseph in Egypt, who by His zeal destroyed the Assyrian army in one night, is now with Jesus and His people.
- The Sanhedrin, by rejecting Jesus and His messengers, are playing the role of Joseph’s brothers, Pharaoh, and Sennacherib.

# [Psalm 32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2032&version=WEB;TLV;OJB)
