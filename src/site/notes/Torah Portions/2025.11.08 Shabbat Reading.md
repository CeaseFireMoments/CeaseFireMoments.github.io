# Patterns
- Defilement and Separation
	- 
- Judgment on the Wicked
- Protection, Covenant Renewal, and Feasts/Worship
- Arrival in Safety and Eternal Rest

# Genesis 33:18-Genesis 35:8 
## [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-33\|Gen-33]]
- #### [[Yada Yada Pauses/01 Gen-33 YadaYada\|01 Gen-33 YadaYada]]

## [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-34\|Gen-34]]

## [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-35\|Gen-35]]

#### My Notes: 
- Arrival in promised land; defilement by Canaanite sin; divine call to separation and worship; God's protection amid judgment on the wicked; covenant renewal at Bethel.

# Nahum 1:12-2:5 
## [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/34 - Nahum/Nah-01\|Nah-01]]

## [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/34 - Nahum/Nah-02\|Nah-02]]

#### My Notes:
- YHWH's judgment utterly destroys the oppressor (Assyria/Nineveh, who afflicted Judah); deliverance and peace for his people; call to worship and feasts; the wicked "cut off" while the remnant is preserved.

# Revelation 22:8-21
## [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/66 - Revelation/Rev-22\|Rev-22]]

#### My Notes:
- Worship YHWH alone; imminent judgment/reward; separation of righteous (access to tree of life, city) from wicked (outside); invitation to eternal life; curse on altering YHWH's word.
# Psalm 28

## [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-28\|Ps-28]]
