# Genesis 37:1-36
- ## [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-37\|Gen-37]]

#### My Notes - Joseph
- Hated by his brothers, stripped of his coat, condemned to death
- Thrown into an empty pit/cistern (בּוֹר, bor – a dry underground chamber, often used in Scripture as an image of the grave/sheol)
- Pulled up out of the pit (v. 28)
- Eventually exalted to save his people

# Jeremiah 38:7-10
- ## [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-38\|Jer-38]]

#### My Notes - Jeremiah
- Falsely accused, condemned, lowered by ropes into a muddy cistern to die of starvation
- Lowered into a cistern (בּוֹר) full of mire – left to sink and die (v. 6)
- Pulled up with ropes out of the cistern (vv. 10–13) - Delivered from death
- Jeremiah spent ≈40 years warning, pleading, weeping, and interceding for Israel to be saved

- ## [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/43 - John/John-19\|John-19]]

#### My Notes - Yeshua/Jesus
- Scourged, condemned though innocent, crucified and buried
- Laid in a new tomb hewn in the rock (a subterranean sepulcher, the ultimate “pit” of death)
- Raised from the dead on the third day; the tomb is found empty (20:1–10)
- Sent to His own people to deliver them, yet rejected and killed by those He came to save.
