Everyone "knows" about the "Mark of the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beast\|Beast]]", even non-Christians. Let's explore this concept and see if there is anything new we can learn about it.

# Scripture: [Revelation 13:16–18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2013%3A16%E2%80%9318&version=WEB;TLV;OJB) 

<mark style="background: #E53E3E;">He</mark> <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//second beast//</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">deceives</mark> <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">my</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">own people</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">who dwell on the earth</mark> <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">because of the signs</mark> <mark style="background: #E53E3E;">he</mark> <mark style="background: #7FC1CFA6;">was granted</mark> to do <mark style="background: #E53E3E;">in front of the beast</mark> <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//first beast//</mark>, saying <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">to those who dwell on the earth</mark> that they should <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">make an image to the beast</mark> <mark style="background: #E53E3E;">who had the sword wound and lived</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #7FC1CFA6;">It was given</mark> <mark style="background: #E53E3E;">to him</mark> <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//second beast//</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">to give breath to it</mark>, <mark style="background: #E53E3E;">to the image of the beast</mark> <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//first beast//</mark>, that the image of the beast <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">should both speak</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast to be killed</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #E53E3E;">He</mark> <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//second beast//</mark>  <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">causes all</mark>, <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">to be given marks on their right hands, or on their foreheads</mark>; and that no one <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark</mark>, <mark style="background: #E53E3E;">which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. </mark>

<mark style="background: #67A9B7A6;">Here is wisdom</mark>. <mark style="background: #67A9B7A6;">He who has understanding</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">let him calculate the number of the beast,</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">for it is the number of a man</mark>. <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">His number is six hundred sixty-six</mark>.

## **<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Who</mark>**:

	- "My own people" - Elohim's people, who dwell on the earth
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beast\|Beast]]s
	- First Beast: From the sea ([Revelation 13:1-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2013%3A1-10&version=WEB;TLV;OJB)) who was wounded and lived.  
	- Second Beast: From the earth. 
	- Image of the beast: Image of the first beast. Given breath by the second beast.

## **<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">What</mark>**: 
- The Second Beast:
	- deceives Elohim's people who dwell on earth
	- tells those who dwell on earth they should make an image of the first beast
	- gives breath to the image of the first beast
	- causes all to be given marks on their right hands or foreheads

## **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark>**:
- The 42 months / 1,260 days / time, times, and half a time begin when the dragon is cast down to the earth (Rev 12:9, 13) and, in great anger persecutes the woman, who then flees into the wilderness for exactly that length of time (Rev 12:6, 14). During this same period the beast exercises worldwide authority and makes war on the saints (Rev 13:5–7).”
- The events of Revelation 13:16–18 most likely occur during the forty-two months in which the beast from the sea is granted authority to act (Rev 13:5).”

# Findings

## A literal mark or implant:
- Exact physical form not indicated in the scripture.
## A mandated by a government agency:
- This scripture indicates the Second Beast is enforcing the mark

## The mark is:
- Given without the persons knowledge: 
	- People are deceived into making an image of the first beast and worshipping it. 
	- Refusing to worship the image of the beast results in being killed.
	- The second beast "causes all" to be given a mark
- Taken voluntarily without realizing it's the Mark of the Beast: 
	- The second beast "causes all" to be given a mark
- Taken voluntarily with full knowledge of what it is: 
	- The second beast "causes all" to be given a mark
- Mandatory and must be refused with full knowledge of the consequence if not taken: 
	- The second beast "causes all" to be given a mark
	- Not able to buy and sell without taking it.
## Representation of allegiance to the Antichrist
- The term “antichrist” appears only in 1–2 John and refers both to a spirit already at work and to many individuals; the singular end-time figure is never called “the Antichrist” in Revelation but is generally identified with the first [[Gate of Wisdom/Beast\|Beast]] and the “man of lawlessness.”
	- See "[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Antichrist\|Antichrist]]" = False Anointed One
	- See [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/False Prophet\|False Prophet]]

## Other Notes:
- If making an image of the first beast and bowing down to it is literal and not doing so results in death, it seems people would be aware of what is happening. The Second Beast deceives by signs - these seem to be things which would be able to be seen. Even if its about being deceived, there seems to be implied awareness of not bowing down results in being killed and not being able to buy and sell if not taking the mark.
- If all this is spiritual, with no literally image to bow down to and no literally mark, it would require spiritual awareness. What would the "spiritual" signs be if they are not literal?
- Across secular, Jewish, Christian, and atheist scholarship Revelation is recognized as primarily apocalyptic literature, defined by use of symbolic, visionary imagery rather than literal description. Apocalyptic texts typically use symbols that speak to both the author’s present historical situation and to hoped-for future divine intervention. While the imagery itself is symbolic, most scholars acknowledge that apocalyptic symbolism may point to real historical forces and, in some cases, to events the author believed would literally occur. 
  
  In this case, the beasts may not literally come up out of the sea and the earth, there may not be a literal image to bow down to, nor a mark. But there would be literal powers with literal submission resulting in literal death and not being able to buy and sell. If this is the case, then the question to ask is what can be learned from this text which would help us recognize the literal representation of the symbolic imagery?
