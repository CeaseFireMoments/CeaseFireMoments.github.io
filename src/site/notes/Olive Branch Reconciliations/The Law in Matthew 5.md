17 Think not that I came to destroy the **_law_** or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil. **18** For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the **_law_**, till all things be accomplished. **19** Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. **20** For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. 

- **Defining**: destroy the law; pass away from the law
    - Greek Word: νόμος (nomos)
    - Hebrew Equivalent: תּוֹרָה (Torah) meaning instructions or teachings
    - This is referencing what can be found in books we now call Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Numbers.
- **Who**:
    - Jesus is speaking to his disciples
    - Who Matthew was writing this for or to is unknown. Some believe it would have been to early believers.
- **What**: Jesus is making note the law:
    - will not be destroyed by him
        - destroy or abolish - The Hebrew mindset would carry the meaning of cancel or nullify
    - will fulfill by him
        - fulfill - The Hebrew mindset would carry the meaning of up hold, establish
    - not one jot or tittle (think comma or apostrophe) will pass away from it until heaven and earth pass away.
        - pass away - The Hebrew mindset would carry the meaning of cease, end of something's existence, being removed
    - break one of the least commandments or will teach men so; do and teach commands
        - commandments are included within the law - Torah
        - commandments - The Hebrew mindset would carry the meaning of good deeds, the right thing to do
        - Those breaking or teaching to break the least command - will be least in the kingdom of heaven.
        - Those doing and teaching the commandments - will be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven
- **When**:
    - **Event**: Estimated Range: Late 29 AD to early 30 AD
    - **Writing**: 50-60 AD - some date it as late as 110 AD
- **Where**: On a mountainside in Galilee in northern Israel
- **Why**: Personal thoughts ... what follows could have been misunderstood as statements which are meant to cancel or nullify the current "Law of God," or "Law of Moses" and Jesus wants to make it perfectly clear this is not the case.
- **How**: NA

[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-05#v40\|Matt-05:40]] And if any man would go to **law** with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.

- **Define**: goes to law with
    - Greek Word: κριθῆναι (krithēnai)
    - Hebrew Equivalent: דִּין (din) meaning judgment, litigation, pleading a case
    - At that time, a coat or tunic would have been valuable. A piece of clothing could have been taken as what we would call collateral for a debit.

- **Who**: Jesus is teaching his disciples
- **What**: If someone takes you into litigation and takes away your coat, give him your cloak as well. Our focus is on the word law - not on the actual meaning of what Jesus is saying.
- **When**: Estimated Range: Late 29 AD to early 30 AD
- **Where**: On a mountainside in Galilee in northern Israel
- **Why**: NA
- **How**: NA
