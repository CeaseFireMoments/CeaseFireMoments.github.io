This scripture isn't directly referencing Sabbath or SabbathS but is related to YHWH's appointed times.

The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified.

Solomon had made him ruler over the House of [[Zunpublished/Joseph\|Joseph]] (1 Kings 11). YHWH gave him ten tribes (1 Kings 11 & 12). Israel made him King over the northern tribes ([[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Israel\|House of Israel]]) (1 Kings 12)
- The people - [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Israel\|House of Israel]] - but not from [[Zunpublished/Levi\|Levi]]
- Feast in Judah (YHWH's [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Feast\|Feast]]) - none were ordained by YHWH on the eighth month on the fifteenth day. [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Feast of Tabernacles\|Feast of Tabernacles]] was set on the fifteenth day of the seventh month.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet. 
- 1 Kings doesn't refer to anyone as a "Jew" the closest equivalent would be the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]]. 
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- Jeroboam ordained and set everything up to be a mimic of what YHWH had ordained:
	- the house on the hill (not on the hill chosen by YHWH)
	- the priests (not from the tribe chosen by YHWH)
	- A feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month (not on the day YHWH chose)
	- Like the feast in Judah indicates his replication of YHWH's feasts
	- On an altar in Bethel (not in the place chosen by YHWH)
	- Sacrificed calves which he had made (not those mandated by YHWH)
	- Devised of his own heart echoes from Deuteronomy 12 not to do what seems right in each man's heart and not to seek what the nations do to worship their gods and then use that to worship YHWH.
- The whole scene described here is a hyperlink back to Exodus 32. They made a calve, Aaron set a feast day to YHWH, and made offerings all of which YHWH judged as an unrighteous act.
