The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Nehemiah 9:14 [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/16 - Nehemiah/Neh-09\|Neh-09]]

"<mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">You</mark> also came down <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">on Mount Sinai</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">spoke</mark> with <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">from heaven</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">gave</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">right ordinances</mark> and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">true laws</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">good statutes and commandments</mark>,  and made known to <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">your</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">holy Sabbath</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commanded</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commandments, statutes, and a law</mark>, <mark style="background: #7FC1CFA6;">by Moses</mark> <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">your servant</mark>, and gave <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">bread from the sky</mark> <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for their hunger</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">brought water out of the rock</mark> for them <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for their thirst</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commanded</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> that <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">they</mark> should <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">go in to possess the land</mark> which <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">you</mark> <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">had sworn to give </mark><mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark>.

- True Laws [[Gate of Wisdom/Torah\|Torah]] instruction or teaching
- Statues [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Statutes (Chuqim)\|Statutes (Chuqim)]] Laws without explicit rationales, often ritual or symbolic (e.g., dietary laws, festivals).

## **Who**:
- You =  YHWH
- Them = [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]]
	- Children Of = Congregation/Ekklesia = Congregation: ēḏāh (עֵדָה) refers to a group of people assembled or gathered together, often with a sense of unity or purpose. It can denote a community, assembly, or congregation, particularly in a religious or communal context.
		- In the New Testament the Greek word is ekklēsia (ἐκκλησία) a gathering or assembly of people, often for a specific purpose, such as a public meeting or community. This word is typically translated as "church."
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]: All the people, both Hebrew and foreigners, who came out of Egypt.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Moses\|Moses]]

## **What**: 
- YHWH came down, spoke, and gave **HIS**:
	- Judgements
	- Torah - teaching and instruction
	- Statues
	- Commandments
- YHWH made known **HIS/YHWH's**: 
	- Holy Sabbath - Set-Apart Day of Rest
	- #### MY NOTE: In the Hebrew Syntax, it is clear Yah made known and it was not through Moses. The Sabbath is not grammatically tied to the phrase "by Moses" — only the commandments, statues, and torah are.
- YHWH commanded *through Moses* **HIS/YHWH's**:
	- Commands
	- Statues
	- Torah - teaching and instruction

	- bread from the sky
	- water from a rock

## **Why**: 
- Bread for hunger.
- Water for thirst.
- Go to the promise land because YHWH swore to give it to them.
- The Hebrew behind "right judgements" implies to be morally upright, fair, and in line with God’s character
- The Hebrew behind "good" implies good, pleasant, beneficial for life, wholesome, and designed for human flourishing.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The returnees are listed by province (Judah), but the genealogies show [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Judah\|Judah]] as the largest group (Ezra 2:3–15, 21–35; Neh 7:8–38). 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]] - “And at Jerusalem dwelt… of the children of Judah… of the children of Benjamin…” The people listed in Nehemiah are from the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi (with some from other tribes).
- Neh 1:2 - "I questioned them about the Jewish (Yehudim - plural for Judah) remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem."
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet.

## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- YHWH made known his Holy Sabbath - personally.
- Nehemiah records YHWH came down and spoke all these things, none of them belong to Moses - not the "Law of Moses" it's the Law of YHWH.
- The translated word "law" here means teaching or instruction.
