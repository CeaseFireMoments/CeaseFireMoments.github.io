The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet. A "Christian" means "follower of Christ" or "belonging to Christ"
- Disciples (a student who learns from his teacher and desires to follow his example) of Jesus of Nazareth went into the assembly on the seventh day which began at sundown on what we now call Friday evening.
- Jesus the Christos (anointed one) went into the assembly on the seventh day which began at sundown on what we now call Friday evening.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- "Jew" in the New Testament can refers to:
	- a person belonging to the Jewish people
	- a descent from Judah/Israel, 
	- a person who adheres to Jewish customs/religion 
	- a person who is a part of the Jewish nation
- The Assembly labeled as a synagogue would indicate any Jews in this passage would have referred to a person who adheres to Jewish customs/religion.
- Jesus, Simon, Andrew, James and John are all descents from Judah or Israel.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- The people waited until sundown on the seventh day - or the start of the first day - to bring the sick.
