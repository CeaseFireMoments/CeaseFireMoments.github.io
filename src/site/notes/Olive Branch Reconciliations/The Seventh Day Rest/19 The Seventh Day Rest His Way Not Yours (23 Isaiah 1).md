The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..
# Scripture: [Isaiah 1:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%201&version=WEB;TLV;OJB)

"What are the multitude of <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> sacrifices to <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">me</mark>?", says <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark>. "I have had <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">enough of the burnt offerings</mark> of rams and the fat of fed animals. I <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">don't delight in the blood</mark> of bulls, or of lambs, or of male goats. 

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When you come to appear before me</mark>, who has required this at your hand, to <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">trample my courts</mark>? <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Bring no more vain offerings</mark>. <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Incense is an abomination to me</mark>. <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations: I can't stand evil assemblies</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">My soul</mark> hates <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> New Moons and <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> appointed feasts. <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">They are a burden to me</mark>. I am weary of bearing them.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
-  Jews at this time are the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]]:
	- The tribe of Judah (dominant)
	- The tribe of Benjamin (absorbed into Judah after 722 BC)
	- Remnants of Levi (priests and Levites who fled north or stayed in Jerusalem)
	- Some survivors from other tribes who defected south after Israel’s fall (2 Chr 11:13–17; 15:9).
	- The Multitude (non-native [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]] - 2 Kings 25) who chose to follow YHWH.
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet.

## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- There are other scriptures later which will show YHWH delights in these when they are done his way and not in vain. Nehemiah 10 
- These things will be observed in the Millennial (1,000-year) kingdom, Ezekiel 45 
- He was burdened because they kept His commandments and festivals but corrupted them with their own ways, he rejects worship that bears His name but not his ways  (YOUR ... VAIN ... ABOMINATION ... EVIL ... HATES)
	- Exodus 32   "When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, "**Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.""** ... Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. ... Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."
	- Isaiah 66  He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig's blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yes, **they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations**:
	- Amos 5  I **hate, I despise your feasts, and I can't stand your solemn assemblies**. Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals. Take away from me the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps. 
	- Matthew 15, Mark 07   For the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God…**In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.”**
	- Matthew 07   "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but **he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven**. Many will tell me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?' Then I will tell them, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.' 
- YHWH detested their rituals because they were covering bloodshed, oppression, and injustice with religious performance—offering sacrifices with hands stained by violence instead of repenting and doing justice. (MULTITUDE ... HAD ENOUGH - WEARY ...)
	- Hosea 06  For I **desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings**. But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant. They were unfaithful to me, there. Matthew 09, Matthew 12 
	- 1 Sam 15    But the people took of the plunder, sheep and cattle, the best of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal." Samuel said, "Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying Yahweh's voice? Behold, **to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams**. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected Yahweh's word, he has also rejected you from being king." 
	- Isaiah 58  Is this the fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to humble his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a reed, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himself? **Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?** "Isn't this the fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke? Isn't it to distribute your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh? 
	- Matthew 06  **Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people**…when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet…when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites…when you fast, do not look gloomy…”
