The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Isaiah 1:13 [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-01\|Isa-01]]

"What are the multitude of <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> sacrifices to <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">me</mark>?", says <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark>. "I have had <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">enough of the burnt offerings</mark> of rams and the fat of fed animals. I <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">don't delight in the blood</mark> of bulls, or of lambs, or of male goats. 

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When you come to appear before me</mark>, who has required this at your hand, to <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">trample my courts</mark>? <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Bring no more vain offerings</mark>. <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Incense is an abomination to me</mark>. <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations: I can't stand evil assemblies</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">My soul</mark> hates <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> New Moons and <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> appointed feasts. <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">They are a burden to me</mark>. I am weary of bearing them. 
## **Define**: 
- Sacrifices = [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Offerings\|Offerings]], commanded by YHWH (e.g., Leviticus 1–7)
- Vain = empty, worthless
- Incense = a symbol of prayer and devotion
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Abomination\|Abomination]] = morally disgusting, detestable, or abhorrent
- New moon, [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/SabbathS\|SabbathS]] , convocations = God-ordained festivals and assemblies (which includes the Seventh Day Rest, see Num. 28–29; Lev. 23) - [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]],

## **Who**:
-  Your = [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]] and those living in Jerusalem.

## **What**: 
- YHWH has had enough of their:
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Burnt Offering\|Burnt Offering]] were offered voluntarily or as part of prescribed rituals to maintain a right relationship with God.  YHWH did not delight in them having to bring Burnt Offerings in order to stay in right relationship with him.
	- Empty and worthless offerings. 
	- Incense which was originally described as a pleasing aroma to YHWH is now a morally disgusting and detestable thing.
	- New Moons, SabbathS (which would include the Seventh Day Rest), convocations had become evil assemblies. 
- YHWH was burdened by YOUR New Moons and Appointed Feasts - up until this point, YHWH has always referred to these as "My New Moons and Appointed Feasts." [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/28 - Hosea/Hos-02\|Hos-02]]
- YWHW is weary of bearing the THEIR New Moons and THERE Festivals

## **When**:
- When they came to appear before YHWH they trampled his courts.

## **Why**: 
- What they were doing was empty, worthless, morally disgusting, detestable, abhorrent

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
-  Jews at this time are the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]]:
	- The tribe of Judah (dominant)
	- The tribe of Benjamin (absorbed into Judah after 722 BC)
	- Remnants of Levi (priests and Levites who fled north or stayed in Jerusalem)
	- Some survivors from other tribes who defected south after Israel’s fall (2 Chr 11:13–17; 15:9).
	- The Multitude (non-native [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]] - 2 Kings 25) who chose to follow YHWH.
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet.

## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- There are other scriptures later which will show YHWH delights in these when they are done his way and not in vain. [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/16 - Nehemiah/Neh-10\|Neh-10]]. 
- These things will be observed in the Millennial (1,000-year) kingdom, [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/26 - Ezekiel/Ezek-45\|Ezek-45]] 
- He was burdened because they kept His commandments and festivals but corrupted them with their own ways, he rejects worship that bears His name but not his ways  (YOUR ... VAIN ... ABOMINATION ... EVIL ... HATES)
	- [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-32\|Exod-32]]  "When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, "**Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.""** ... Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. ... Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."
	- [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-66\|Isa-66]] He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig's blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yes, **they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations**:
	- [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/30 - Amos/Am-05\|Am-05]] I **hate, I despise your feasts, and I can't stand your solemn assemblies**. Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals. Take away from me the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps. 
	- [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-15\|Matt-15]],[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/41 - Mark/Mark-07\|Mark-07]]  For the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God…**In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.”**
	- [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-07\|Matt-07]]  "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but **he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven**. Many will tell me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?' Then I will tell them, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.' 
- YHWH detested their rituals because they were covering bloodshed, oppression, and injustice with religious performance—offering sacrifices with hands stained by violence instead of repenting and doing justice. (MULTITUDE ... HAD ENOUGH - WEARY ...)
	-  [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/28 - Hosea/Hos-06\|Hos-06]] For I **desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings**. But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant. They were unfaithful to me, there. [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-09\|Matt-09]], [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-12\|Matt-12]]
	- [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/09 - 1 Samuel/1 Sam-15\|1 Sam-15]]   But the people took of the plunder, sheep and cattle, the best of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal." Samuel said, "Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying Yahweh's voice? Behold, **to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams**. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected Yahweh's word, he has also rejected you from being king." 
	- [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-58\|Isa-58]] Is this the fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to humble his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a reed, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himself? **Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?** "Isn't this the fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke? Isn't it to distribute your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh? 
	- [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-06\|Matt-06]] **Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people**…when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet…when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites…when you fast, do not look gloomy…”
