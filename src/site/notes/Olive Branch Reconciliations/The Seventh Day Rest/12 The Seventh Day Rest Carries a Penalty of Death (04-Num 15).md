The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: [Numbers 15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2015&version=WEB;TLV;OJB):32-36 

32 <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">While</mark> the <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">children of Israel</mark> were <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">in the wilderness</mark>, <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">they</mark> found <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">a man</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">gathering sticks</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the Sabbath day</mark>. 33 <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">Those who found him</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">gathering sticks</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">brought him</mark> to <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Moses and Aaron</mark>, and to <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">all the congregation</mark>. 34 <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">They</mark> put <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">him</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">in custody</mark>, <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">because it had not been declared what should be done</mark> to him.

35 <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Yahweh</mark> said to <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Moses</mark>, “<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">The man</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">shall surely be put to death</mark>. <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">All the congregation</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">stone him with stones</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">outside of the camp</mark>.” 36 <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">All the congregation</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">brought him</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">outside of the camp</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">stoned him to death with stones</mark>, as <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Yahweh</mark> commanded <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Moses</mark>.
