Head on over to our [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClucQfZWQ3dSZFMMoEfg5gA) and check out the shorts we are dropping daily. We’ve taken one long video and broken it up into Shorts – less than 60 seconds each. You can find them all on the shorts playlist.

Click here to go to [Sabbath play list](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbihUkS-becufFp6q1-X-mBHCyfwAatrW&si=nArorXDwEWbCfu3X) and skip to the first Shorts.

Or click here for the long video [Scripture Survey: Sabbath and Seventh Day Rest](https://youtu.be/-6fYhyNBjNU).

This is a video covering all the scriptures referring to the Sabbath or Seventh Day Rest. It is a long one and may need to be a couple cups of coffee or tea over a couple days. But if you’ve wanted to see what was said about the Sabbath Day, this is the one to watch. Wondering who the Sabbath day was given to – was it just the Jews – this is the one to watch. Did Jesus keep the Sabbath? Did the disciples or Paul? Is the Sabbath day mentioned in the New Testament? This is the one to watch to get those answers. Remember, in a Ceasefire Moment we have to be willing to set aside all our pre-conceived ideas and seek to understand – not necessarily to agree.
