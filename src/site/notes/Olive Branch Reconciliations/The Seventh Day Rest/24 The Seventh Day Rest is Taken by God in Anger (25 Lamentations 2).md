The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation.

## **<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Who</mark>**:
-  The king and the priest - not a specific person - the offices of such. The Davidic line were the kings, the Aaronic line were the priests. [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/28 - Hosea/Hos-03#v4\|Hos-03#v4]], [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-33#v21\|Jer-33#v21]]

- YHWH has:
	- violently taken away his tabernacle as if a garden [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-03#v24\|Gen-03#v24]]
	- destroyed his place of assembly (booth, tabernacle, temple)
	- caused the appointed times and Sabbath to be forgotten in Jerusalem
	- despised the king and the priest
	- cast off his altar
	- abhorred his sanctuary
	- given the walls and palaces of Jerusalem into the hand of the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Babylonians\|Babylonians]]
	- called Jerusalem's enemies on every side
	- caused no one to escape or remain because of his anger	- 
- The Enemy - Babylon has 
	- made a noise in YHWH's house shouts of joy and triumph just as YHWH's followers did on his appointed [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Feast\|Feast]]
	- consumed, taken captive, the people Jerusalem has cared for and brought up
## **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark>**:
- Appointed times and weekly Sabbath were caused to be forgotten
- In the day of YHWH's anger - the day the Babylonians took Jerusalem

-  YWHW was angry:
	- [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/25 - Lamentations/Lam-01#v5\|Lam-01#v5]] - adversaries had become Jerusalem's master
	- [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/25 - Lamentations/Lam-01#v8\|Lam-01#v8]] - Jerusalem had become and unclean thing because of multitude of transgressions
	- [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/25 - Lamentations/Lam-01#v18\|Lam-01#v18]] Jerusalem had rebelled against YHWH's commandment
	- [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/25 - Lamentations/Lam-04#v13\|Lam-04#v13]] had been lead into sin and transgressions by her prophets and her priests

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet. 
- At this time the inhabitants of Jerusalem - those living in the city would later become known as "Jews." They were the remnant of Judah from the tribe of Judah, Benjamin, and some Levites known as the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]]
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.
- Noting this describes YHWH taken away the Sabbath due to his anger as a consequence of sin and transgressions by his people.

## Other Notes:
- Spoken of outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]]
- Causing it to be forgot is a punishment.
