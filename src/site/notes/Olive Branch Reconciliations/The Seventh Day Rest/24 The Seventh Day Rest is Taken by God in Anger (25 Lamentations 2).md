The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet. 
- At this time the inhabitants of Jerusalem - those living in the city would later become known as "Jews." They were the remnant of Judah from the tribe of Judah, Benjamin, and some Levites known as the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]]
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.
- Noting this describes YHWH taken away the Sabbath due to his anger as a consequence of sin and transgressions by his people.

## Other Notes:
- Spoken of outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]]
- Causing it to be forgot is a punishment.
