The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Number 28:9-10 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-28#v9\|Num-28#v9]]

""'On the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Sabbath day</mark>, <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> shall offer <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">two male lambs a year old without defect</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">two tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering mixed with oil</mark>, and its <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">drink offering</mark>: this is the <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">burnt offering</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">of every Sabbath</mark>, in addition to the <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">continual burnt offering</mark> and its <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">drink offering</mark>.

	- In the New Testament the Greek word is ekklēsia (ἐκκλησία) a gathering or assembly of people, often for a specific purpose, such as a public meeting or community. This word is typically translated as "church."

	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Daily Offering\|Daily Offering]]
## **When**:
- Sabbath Day - Seven Day

## **Why**: 
- [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-28#v2\|Num-28#v2]] as a pleasant aroma to YHWH

# Findings

## It is a Jewish thing:

## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
