The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..

# Scripture: [Ezekiel 46:1-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2046%3A1-12&version=TLV;OJB;WEB) 

This is a large detailed section of scripture, we are only going to list here the parts addressing the Sabbath and SabbathS.

He shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go out straight before him. 
v11: "'"<mark style="background: #A284CDA6;">In the feasts and in the solemnities</mark> <mark style="background: #67CD83A6;">the meal offering</mark> shall be an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

Then he shall go out; and after his going out one shall shut the gate.

- The people of the land (ʿam ha-aretz):
	- Ordinary inhabitants of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]/Judah (Ezekiel 7:27, Ezekiel 12:19)
	- The multitudes of the land (Acts 4:25–27)

## **<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">What</mark>**: 
- The gates to the Inner Courts ([[Zunpublished/Set Apart Place\|Set Apart Place]] ) will be:

## **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark>**:
- Six days the inner courts will be shut
- On the Seventh day (Sabbath), new moon, appointed feasts the inner courts will be open

## **<mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">Why</mark>**: 
- So the people of the land can worship YHWH on the Sabbath, Sabbaths, and New Moons

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet. 
- Ezekiel doesn't refer to anyone as a "Jew" the closest equivalent would be the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Jacob\|House of Jacob]]. Ezekiel 37 joins the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]] and the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Israel\|House of Israel]] back into one nation. 
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- It is generally believed Ezekiel 46 describes a highly detailed temple **that has never yet existed** in history. 
- How does the thought Jesus replaced the Sabbath reconcile with Christians believing it is either a literal future fulfillment during the Christ’s millennial reign OR a symbolic prophecy already fulfilled in Jesus and His church?
	- If it is a future event occurring during the millennial reign, Jesus would have only replaced the Sabbath for a specific period of time, however, it is clearly brought back. 
	- If it is prophecy already fulfilled in Jesus and His church and Jesus replaced the Sabbath - why is the Sabbath still being kept in Ezekiel's prophecy?

## Other Notes:
- Being addressed outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/T/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/C/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]] 
- Exists in the future - after the Messiah comes
