The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Exodus 31:12-18

<mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Yahweh</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">spoke</mark> to <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Moses</mark>, saying, 

"Speak also to the <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">children of Israel</mark>, saying, '<mark style="background: #FF9EF6A6;">Most certainly</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">keep</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">my</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Sabbaths</mark>; <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for it is a sign between</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">me</mark> and <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">throughout</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">generations</mark>, that <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> may know that <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">I am Yahweh who</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">sanctifies</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">You</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">keep</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">the Sabbath</mark> therefore, <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for it is holy </mark>to <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark>. <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Everyone who</mark> <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">profanes it</mark> shall surely <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">be put to death</mark>; for <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">whoever</mark> does any <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">work</mark> therein, that soul <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">shall be cut off from among his people</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Six days</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">work</mark> be done, but <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the seventh day</mark> is a <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Sabbath of solemn rest</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">holy</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">to Yahweh</mark>. <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Whoever</mark> does any <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">work</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the Sabbath day</mark> shall surely <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">be put to death</mark>. 

Therefore <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">the children of Israel</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">keep the Sabbath</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">to observe the Sabbath</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">throughout their generations</mark>, for a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">perpetual</mark> [[Zunpublished/Covenant\|Covenant]]. 

<mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">It is a sign between</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">me</mark> and <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">the children of Israel</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">forever</mark>; <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth</mark>, and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the seventh day</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">he</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">rested, and was refreshed</mark>.'" 

When <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">he</mark> finished speaking with <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">him</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">on Mount Sinai</mark>, <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">he</mark> gave <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">Moses</mark> the <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">two tablets of the covenant</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">stone tablets</mark>, written with <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">God</mark>'s finger.

## **Define**: 
- Desecrate (chalal) means to profane, pollute, or treat as common something that is set-apart (holy). To treat it as an ordinary day by working.
- Sign (oth) a perpetual (on-going) distinguishing mark, token, or symbol that serves as evidence of a covenant or relationship between God and His people. The Rainbow in Noah's account is an oth. Oth can be related to the word Sphragis translated as 'seal' in Revelation 9:4 ([[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/66 - Revelation/Rev-09#v4\|Rev-09#v4]])

## **Who**:
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Moses\|Moses]] - Moses is being spoken to by Yah-God. God mentions:
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]]
	- Anyone - Anyone who desecrates it will be put to death.
	- Those who do work - cut off from their people.

## **What**: 
- Verse 12: MUST observe Yah-God's [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/SabbathS\|SabbathS]] ([[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]] )
	- Notice God has claimed these times as HIS.
	- Notice the plural here - this isn't just about the [[Gate of Wisdom/Seventh Day\|Seventh Day]] Rest. 
- Verse 14: Observe the Seventh Day Rest
- Consequences for NOT observing the Seventh Day Rest:
	- Desecrate = death
	- Whoever works on this day will surely be put to death. [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-02#v17\|Gen-02#v17]]
- The Seventh Day Rest is set apart to God.
## **When**:
- For generations to come.
- This Perpetual Sign/Mark was given before the tablets of stone were written by the finger of God and given to Moses.

## **Why**: 
- Observing God's Sabbath**s** is a sign between God and the person observing them.
- So the person observing the Sabbath**s** will know that Yah-God is their god who makes them set-apart.
- Because the Seventh Day Rest is set apart **FOR** the observer
- Because God ceased from work and rested after creating heaven and earth. 

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- .According to this passage, the Seventh Day of Rest is given TO the observer as a sign or mark of a covenant between Yah-God and the person who sees him as their god. It is a command BEFORE the Ten Words are given on tablets of stone. 
- Christians don't exist yet. 
## It is a Jewish thing: 
-  Jews do not exist yet.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet. 

## Other Notes:
- This is given outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Words\|Ten Words]].
- The tablets are called the tablets of the covenant.
