The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..

# Scripture: [Psalm 104:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20104%3A19&version=TLV;OJB;WEB)

He appointed the moon for seasons.
    The sun knows when to set.

## **Define**: 
- Appointed = "made...for" is more literal to the Hebrew structure
- Seasons = [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]] Used for every single one of YHWH's days in Leviticus 23 (including the weekly Sabbath).
## **<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Who</mark>**:
-  He = YHWH, God

## **<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">What</mark>**: 
- Made the moon for his appointed times
- Sun knows when to set
## **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark>**:
- at the appointed time

## **<mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">Why</mark>**: 
- The moon for appointed times.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The moon was created before man, so it being made for appointed times would indicate the appointed times were are not a "Jewish" thing.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- The moon was created for the Seventh Day before the [[Gate of Wisdom/T/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/C/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]] existed.
- If the moon is made for appointed times, such as the Seventh Day Rest, what is it's purpose if Jesus replaced the Seventh Day Rest?
