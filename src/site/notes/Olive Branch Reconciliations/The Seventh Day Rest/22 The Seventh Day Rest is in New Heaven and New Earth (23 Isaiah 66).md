The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Isaiah 66:21-24 [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-66#v23\|Isa-66#v23]]

"<mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">For</mark> as <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">the new heavens</mark> and <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">the new </mark>earth, which<mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;"> I </mark>will make, shall <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">remain before</mark> <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">me</mark>," says <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark>, "so <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> <mark style="background: #DDCC5EA6;">offspring</mark> and <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">name shall remain</mark>. 

It shall happen that <mark style="background: #A284CDA6;">from one new moon to another</mark>, and <mark style="background: #A284CDA6;">from one Sabbath to another</mark>, <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">all flesh</mark> <mark style="background: #61A273A6;">will come to worship before me</mark>," says <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark>. 

"<mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">They</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">will go out</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">look at the dead bodies</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">of the men</mark> <mark style="background: #4FA466A6;">who have transgressed against</mark> <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">me</mark>; <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">their</mark> <mark style="background: #94DEA9A6;">worm will not die</mark>, nor will <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">their</mark> <mark style="background: #94DEA9A6;">fire be quenched</mark>, and <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">they</mark> will<mark style="background: #94DEA9A6;"> be loathsome</mark> to all mankind."

## **Define**: 
- New - chadashim (חָדָשִׁים), adj., plural): renew, anew, afresh, etc. Knowing which is intended is determined by context. 
	- The core, primitive meaning of the root _H-D-Sh_ is to renew, repair, or restore something to its former, intended condition or vigor.
- New [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Yah/Heaven\|Heaven]]s and a New Earth = renewed cosmos free from curse and decay [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/66 - Revelation/Rev-21\|Rev-21]] & [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/66 - Revelation/Rev-22\|Rev-22]]
- Offspring/[[Zunpublished/Seed\|Seed]] = often used covenantally for the continuing line
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Name\|Name]] = reputation, identity, renown; 
	- enduring “name” means Israel will never lose her covenant identity or be blotted out.
- New Moon - Specific [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Burnt Offering\|Burnt Offering]]s were to be made at the beginning of each month. [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-28#v11\|Num-28#v11]]-15
- Sabbath = Weekly [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] - Seventh Day Rest. 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Transgression\|Transgression]] - willful breaking of covenant, not keeping YHWH's ways.
- Idioms:
	- worm shall not die: unending, conscious torment and corruption in judgment
	- fire not quenched: irreversible, unending punishment, frequently used in Scripture for final judgment
	- loathsome to all: the objects of ultimate horror, loathing, and disgust to all the redeemed

## **<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Who</mark>**:
- Your - [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]] [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-31\|Jer-31]] [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-32\|Jer-32]]
	- In verses 18-21 YHWH describes gathering all nations and tongues to see his glory and make them [[priests\|priests]] and for [[Zunpublished/Levites\|Levites]]
	- the principle of enduring “seed” applies also to the believing remnant and to all who are incorporated into the promises through the Messiah [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/48 - Galatians/Gal-03#v28\|Gal-03#v28]]-29 and [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-09\|Rom-09]], [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-10\|Rom-10]], and [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-11\|Rom-11]] 
- All Flesh - All mankind except those who have transgressed against YHWH
- Men who transgressed against YHWH

## **<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">What</mark>**: 
- New heaven and new earth will remain before YHWH
	- So will the offspring and the reputation or identity of Israel 
- All Flesh will come to worship YHWH
	- on each new moon
	- on each Sabbath
- All flesh will go out from worship YHWH
	- and look on the dead bodies of those who have transgressed YHWH
- Mankind who transgresses against YHWH will
	- have a worm that will not die
	- fire that will not be quench
	- be loathsome to all who have not transgressed YHWH
## **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark>**:
- AFTER the new heavens and new earth exist [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-05#v18\|Matt-05#v18]]
- On New Moons and [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/SabbathS\|SabbathS]]

## **<mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">Why</mark>**: 
- For ... Redeemed: because the new heaven and new earth are indestructible and eternal the promises in [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-66#v18\|Isa-66#v18]]-21 (enduring seed, gentile priests, universal worship) will endure forever. 
- For ... Transgressors: because of transgression against YWHW, the worm will never die, the fire never be quenched, and they will be forever loathsome.  

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet at the time of Isaiah writing.
- However, at the time of Fulfillment of this prophecy:
	- Isaiah 66:18–21 explicitly says that from “all nations and tongues” some will be brought as an offering to the Lord and even taken as “priests and Levites”.
	- “All flesh” (Jew and Gentile alike) comes to worship (66:23)
	- Not every physical descendant, but those who are circumcised in heart, who tremble at God’s word (Isa 66:2, 5), and who have been cleansed and given a new heart ([[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-66#v17\|Isa-66#v17]]–18; [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/26 - Ezekiel/Ezek-36#v24\|Ezek-36#v24]]–28; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-11#v26\|Rom-11#v26]].
	- Every believer (Jew or Gentile) is incorporated into the true Israel through faith in the Messiah ([[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/48 - Galatians/Gal-03#v28\|Gal-03#v28]]–29; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-02#v28\|Rom-02#v28]]–29; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-02#v11\|Ephes-02#v11]]–22; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/60 - 1 Peter/1 Pet-02#v9\|1 Pet-02#v9]]–10).
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- YWHW makes it very clear in Isaiah 66 this is NOT a "Jewish" thing and that ALL flesh will worship him on the New Moons and the Seventh Day Rest-Weekly Sabbath.
- At the time of Isaiah's writing:
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]]
		- The tribe of Judah (dominant)
		- The tribe of Benjamin (absorbed into Judah after 722 BC)
		- Remnants of Levi (priests and Levites who fled north or stayed in Jerusalem)
		- Some survivors from other tribes who defected south after Israel’s fall (2 Chr 11:13–17; 15:9).
		- The Multitude (non-native [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]] - 2 Kings 25) who chose to follow YHWH.
	- Residence of Jerusalem
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet. 

## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.
- Because this is prophecy to be fulfilled later and because it explicitly indicates it is at the time of the New Heaven and New Earth - When would Jesus replace the Sabbath? YHWH specifically states here: It shall happen that <mark style="background: #A284CDA6;">from one new moon to another</mark>, and <mark style="background: #A284CDA6;">from one Sabbath to another</mark>, <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">all flesh</mark> <mark style="background: #61A273A6;">will come to worship before me</mark>," says <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark>.
