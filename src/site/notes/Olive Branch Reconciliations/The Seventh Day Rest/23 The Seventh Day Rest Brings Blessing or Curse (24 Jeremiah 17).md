The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Jeremiah 17:21-27 [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-17\|Jer-17]]

<mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark> says, "<mark style="background: #61A273A6;">Be careful, and bear no burden</mark> on <mark style="background: #A284CDA6;">the Sabbath day</mark>, <mark style="background: #61A273A6;">nor bring it in</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">by the gates of Jerusalem</mark>.  <mark style="background: #61A273A6;">Don't carry a burden out of your houses</mark> <mark style="background: #A284CDA6;">on the Sabbath day</mark>. <mark style="background: #61A273A6;">Don't do any work</mark>, but <mark style="background: #61A273A6;">make the Sabbath day holy</mark>, as<mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;"> I </mark>commanded <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">fathers</mark>.

<mark style="background: #CFA57FA6;">It will happen, if</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">diligently listen to me</mark>," says <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark>, "<mark style="background: #61A273A6;">to bring in no burden through the gates of this city</mark> <mark style="background: #A284CDA6;">on the Sabbath day</mark>, but to <mark style="background: #61A273A6;">make the Sabbath day holy</mark>, to <mark style="background: #61A273A6;">do no work</mark> therein; <mark style="background: #CFA57FA6;">then</mark> <mark style="background: #94DEA9A6;">there will enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on David's throne, riding in chariots and on horses</mark>, <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">they, and their princes</mark>, <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">the men of Judah</mark>, and the <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">inhabitants of Jerusalem</mark>; and <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">this city</mark> will <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">remain forever</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">They</mark> will come <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">from the cities of Judah</mark>, and <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">from the places around Jerusalem</mark>, from the <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">land of Benjamin</mark>, <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">from the lowland</mark>, <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">from the hill country</mark>, and <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">from the South</mark>, <mark style="background: #67CD83A6;">bringing burnt offerings</mark>, <mark style="background: #67CD83A6;">sacrifices</mark>, <mark style="background: #67CD83A6;">meal offerings</mark>, <mark style="background: #67CD83A6;">and frankincense</mark>, and <mark style="background: #67CD83A6;">bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving</mark>, <mark style="background: #258FE5A6;">to Yahweh's house</mark>.
