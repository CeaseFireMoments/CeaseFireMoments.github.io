The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..

## **Define**: 
- The Prince
	- It appears in the verse as הַנָּשִׂיא (ha-nāśîʾ), meaning "the prince" (with the definite article ha-).
	- Literally conveys the idea of "one who is lifted up" or "exalted one."
	- This "prince" is a prominent civil/leadership figure responsible for providing offerings and allotments of land, distinct from priests and not equated with a king (melekh) or the Messiah.
	- A related but distinct Hebrew term for "prince" (often implying a royal son/heir or anointed one) is נָסִיךְ (nasikh), from a different root meaning "to pour" (as in anointing oil), but that's not the word used here.
