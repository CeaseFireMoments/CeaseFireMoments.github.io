The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..
# Scripture: [Exodus 35:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2035&version=WEB;TLV;OJB)

<mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Moses</mark> assembled <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">all the congregation of the children of Israel</mark>, and said to <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark>, "These are the words which <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">Yahweh</mark> has <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commanded</mark>, that <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> should <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">do them</mark>. 

'<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Six days</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">work</mark> be done, but <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the seventh day</mark> there shall be <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">a holy day</mark> for <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark>, a <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Sabbath of solemn rest</mark> <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">to Yahweh</mark>: <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">whoever</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">does any work in it shall be put to death</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">You</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">kindle no fire</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">throughout your habitations</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the Sabbath day</mark>.'" 

## **Define**: 
- NA
## **Who**:
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Assembly\|Assembly]]: Congregation ēḏāh (עֵדָה); Church ekklesia (ἐκκλησία)
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]: All the people, both Hebrew and foreigners, who came out of Egypt.

## **What**: 
- Commandment from Yah-God
- Six days work
- Seventh day shall be your set-apart day, a day of Sabbath rest
- Those who work will die.
- Do not kindle a fire in your dwellings.
	- This is the only place this is recorded and it is right before discussion on building elements of the Tabernacle which would require fire. 
## **When**:
- The tablets of stone ([[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Most Set Apart Place/Tablets of Testimony\|Tablets of Testimony]]) have been given, the [[Zunpublished/Covenant\|Covenant]] cut, the [[Gate of Wisdom/T/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] (aka [[Gate of Wisdom/C/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]]) spoken.
- But just before Moses is about to give the directions on how to build the [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Tabernacle\|Tabernacle]], the [[Gate of Wisdom/D/Seventh Day\|Seventh Day]] Rest is addressed again.

## **Why**: 
- The Sabbath is always referenced "rest TO God."
- There isn't any reason given for why it is repeated. It was just given in Exodus 34:21  and here it is repeated outside the Ten Words.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christian do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
-  Jews do not exist yet.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- This is given outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/T/Ten Words\|Ten Words]].
