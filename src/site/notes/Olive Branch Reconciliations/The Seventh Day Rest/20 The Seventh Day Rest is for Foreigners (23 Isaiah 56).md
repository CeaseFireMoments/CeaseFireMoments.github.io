The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..
# Scripture: [Isaiah 56:2-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2056&version=WEB;TLV;OJB)

<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Blessed</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">is the man</mark> who <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">does this</mark>, and the son of man who <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">holds it fast</mark>; who <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">keeps the Sabbath without profaning it </mark>and keeps<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;"> his hand from doing any evil</mark>." 

<mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">Let no foreigner</mark> who has joined himself to <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark> speak, saying, "<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Yahweh will surely separate me from his people</mark>." Do not let the <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">eunuch</mark> say, "Behold, I am a dry tree."  For Yahweh says, "<mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">To the eunuchs who keep</mark> <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">my</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Sabbaths</mark>, <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">choose the things that please me</mark>, and <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">hold fast to my covenant</mark>, <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">I</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">will give them in my house and within my walls a memorial</mark> and a <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">name better than of sons and of daughters</mark>. <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">I </mark><mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">will give them an everlasting name</mark> that will not be cut off. 

<mark style="background: #A8ADB8A6;">Also</mark> the <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">foreigners</mark> who join themselves to Yahweh to serve him, and to love Yahweh's name, to be his servants, <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">everyone who keeps the Sabbath</mark> from profaning it, and <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">holds fast my covenant</mark>, 

## **Define**: 
- the man - any human being
- does this - keeps the Sabbath without profaning it and keeps from doing evil

- evil - bad, wicked, displeasing, harmful, any act contrary to what God says is good.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/F/Foreigner\|Foreigner]] - literally “son of a foreigner”
	- A Foreigner was someone who was not a native born Israelite who wanted to follow Yahweh / God. In the New Testament these would be Gentiles who wanted to follow Jesus.

- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] - Singular referring to the Seventh Day Rest in verses 2 and 6. The Sabbath Day is a covenant sign.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/SabbathS\|SabbathS]] - Plural in vs 4 [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]]
- [[Zunpublished/Covenant\|Covenant]] - YHWH's covenant with [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]], given at [[Zunpublished/Mount Sinai\|Mount Sinai]]. Revealed in Moses [[Gate of Wisdom/Covenant/Mosaic\|Mosaic]], promised to Abraham [[Gate of Wisdom/Covenant/Abrahamic\|Abrahamic]], and renewed in the Servant (Isa 42:6; 49:8).
	- [[Sacred Truces/What is the New Covenant\|What is the New Covenant]] Fulfillment Heb-08, Eph 02 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/M/Memorial\|Memorial]] - permanent remembrance or enduring name in God’s house.

## **Who**:
-  The man, any human, including the eunuch and foreigner who:
	- keeps YHWH's Sabbath without profaning it 
	- keeps hand from doing evil, 
	- joins to YWHW, serves him 
	- keeps YHWH's SabbathS
	- chooses what pleases YHWH
	- Hold's fast to the Mosaic and Abrahamic Covenants

## **When**:
- This is not supplied in the text, however, Chapters 40–55 just spoke of comfort and how God will gather exiles through the Servant [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Heavenly Beings/Messiah\|Messiah]]. 
- Isa-55  just revealed a universal invitation to the new covenant—“Come… buy wine and milk without money” (55:1); God’s word will not return void (55:10–11); joy in return from exile (55:12–13).  Isaiah 56:1: “Thus says the LORD” links the free offer of grace to the demand for obedience.

## **Why**: 
- That the man will not be cut-off.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
- However, in this Old Testament writing, YHWH is inviting ALL to keep his Sabbath and SabbathS. 
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- God has made it clear here it is not just a "Jewish thing." Even the Eunuch and Foreigner should keep it.  
- Jews at this time are the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]]:
	- The tribe of Judah (dominant)
	- The tribe of Benjamin (absorbed into Judah after 722 BC)
	- Remnants of Levi (priests and Levites who fled north or stayed in Jerusalem)
	- Some survivors from other tribes who defected south after Israel’s fall (2 Chr 11:13–17; 15:9).
	- The Multitude (non-native [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]] - 2 Kings 25) who chose to follow YHWH.
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- Given outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]]
- Isaiah 56 is the [[Zunpublished/Gospel\|Gospel]] in the Old Testament—God’s salvation is near, so all who keep covenant by faith (even outsiders) are welcomed into His house, while hypocritical leaders face judgment.
- Inclusion of ALL - the whosoever's was fulfilled by Jesus, the Messiah. Acts-08:27
