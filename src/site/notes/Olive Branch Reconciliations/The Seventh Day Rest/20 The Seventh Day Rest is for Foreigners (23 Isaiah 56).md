The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Isaiah 56:2-6 [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-56\|Isa-56]]

<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Blessed</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">is the man</mark> who <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">does this</mark>, and the son of man who <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">holds it fast</mark>; who <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">keeps the Sabbath without profaning it </mark>and keeps<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;"> his hand from doing any evil</mark>." 

<mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">Let no foreigner</mark> who has joined himself to <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark> speak, saying, "<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Yahweh will surely separate me from his people</mark>." Do not let the <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">eunuch</mark> say, "Behold, I am a dry tree."  For Yahweh says, "<mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">To the eunuchs who keep</mark> <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">my</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Sabbaths</mark>, <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">choose the things that please me</mark>, and <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">hold fast to my covenant</mark>, <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">I</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">will give them in my house and within my walls a memorial</mark> and a <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">name better than of sons and of daughters</mark>. <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">I </mark><mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">will give them an everlasting name</mark> that will not be cut off. 

<mark style="background: #A8ADB8A6;">Also</mark> the <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">foreigners</mark> who join themselves to Yahweh to serve him, and to love Yahweh's name, to be his servants, <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">everyone who keeps the Sabbath</mark> from profaning it, and <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">holds fast my covenant</mark>, 

## **Define**: 
- the man - any human being
- does this - keeps the Sabbath without profaning it and keeps from doing evil
- profaning - to profane, defile, desecrate, treat as common (treat it as an ordinary day instead of a set-apart day) [[Gate of Wisdom/Unclean, Common, Clean, Holy\|Unclean, Common, Clean, Holy]]
- evil - bad, wicked, displeasing, harmful, any act contrary to what God says is good.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Foreigner\|Foreigner]] - literally “son of a foreigner”
	- A Foreigner was someone who was not a native born Israelite who wanted to follow Yahweh / God. In the New Testament these would be Gentiles who wanted to follow Jesus.
- Eunuch - The most common definition of a eunuch in the Bible is a man who has been physically castrated, impotent or was born that way. [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-23#v1\|Deut-23#v1]]
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] - Singular referring to the Seventh Day Rest in verses 2 and 6. The Sabbath Day is a covenant sign.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/SabbathS\|SabbathS]] - Plural in vs 4 [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]]
- [[Zunpublished/Covenant\|Covenant]] - YHWH's covenant with [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]], given at [[Zunpublished/Mount Sinai\|Mount Sinai]]. Revealed in Moses [[Gate of Wisdom/Covenant/Mosaic\|Mosaic]], promised to Abraham [[Gate of Wisdom/Covenant/Abrahamic\|Abrahamic]], and renewed in the Servant (Isa 42:6; 49:8).
	- [[Sacred Truces/What is the New Covenant\|What is the New Covenant]] Fulfillment [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/58 - Hebrews/Heb-08#v6\|Heb-08#v6]]-13; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-02#v12\|Ephes-02#v12]]-19
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Memorial\|Memorial]] - permanent remembrance or enduring name in God’s house.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Name\|Name]] name, reputation, fame, memorial, renown, identity. To have a name with God is to have recognition, covenant belonging, and honor.

## **Who**:
-  The man, any human, including the eunuch and foreigner who:
	- keeps YHWH's Sabbath without profaning it 
	- keeps hand from doing evil, 
	- joins to YWHW, serves him 
	- keeps YHWH's SabbathS
	- chooses what pleases YHWH
	- Hold's fast to the Mosaic and Abrahamic Covenants
	- Love who YHWH is (name)

## **What**: 
- **IF** a man does the things listed above YHWH will:
	- give them permanent remembrance where YHWH is
	- a better, everlasting reputation, identity
		- better than that of sons and daughters 
	- [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/66 - Revelation/Rev-03#v5\|Rev-03#v5]],  [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/66 - Revelation/Rev-13#v8\|Rev-13#v8]],  [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/42 - Luke/Luke-10#v20\|Luke-10#v20]], [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/39 - Malachi/Mal-03#v16\|Mal-03#v16]], [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/27 - Daniel/Dan-12#v1\|Dan-12#v1]]
## **When**:
- This is not supplied in the text, however, Chapters 40–55 just spoke of comfort and how God will gather exiles through the Servant [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Heavenly Beings/Messiah\|Messiah]]. 
- [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-55\|Isa-55]] just revealed a universal invitation to the new covenant—“Come… buy wine and milk without money” (55:1); God’s word will not return void (55:10–11); joy in return from exile (55:12–13).  Isaiah 56:1: “Thus says the LORD” links the free offer of grace to the demand for obedience.

## **Why**: 
- That the man will not be cut-off.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
- However, in this Old Testament writing, YHWH is inviting ALL to keep his Sabbath and SabbathS. 
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- God has made it clear here it is not just a "Jewish thing." Even the Eunuch and Foreigner should keep it.  
- Jews at this time are the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]]:
	- The tribe of Judah (dominant)
	- The tribe of Benjamin (absorbed into Judah after 722 BC)
	- Remnants of Levi (priests and Levites who fled north or stayed in Jerusalem)
	- Some survivors from other tribes who defected south after Israel’s fall (2 Chr 11:13–17; 15:9).
	- The Multitude (non-native [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]] - 2 Kings 25) who chose to follow YHWH.
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- Given outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]]
- Isaiah 56 is the [[Zunpublished/Gospel\|Gospel]] in the Old Testament—God’s salvation is near, so all who keep covenant by faith (even outsiders) are welcomed into His house, while hypocritical leaders face judgment.
- Inclusion of ALL - the whosoever's was fulfilled by Jesus, the Messiah. [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/44 - Acts/Acts-08#v27\|Acts-08#v27]]
