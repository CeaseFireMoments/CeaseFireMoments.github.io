The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..

- [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Statutes (Chuqim)\|Statutes (Chuqim)]]
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Feast\|Feast]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/SabbathS\|SabbathS]]
## **<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Who</mark>**:
- Ezekiel 44:15 - The Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who performed the duty of YHWH sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from YHWH
- My People - [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Jacob\|House of Jacob]]
	- [Ezekiel 47:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezek%2047%3A22%E2%80%9323%20&version=TLV;OJB;WEB) includes outsiders

## **<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">What</mark>**: 
- The Levitical Priests from the line of Zadok will:
	- teach the difference between the holy and common
	- cause YHWH's people to discern between the unclean and the clean
	- will stand to judge according to YHWH's ordinances
	- will keep YHWH's laws
	- will keep YHWH's statues regarding the Appointed Feasts
	- will keep YHWH's Sabbath's holy
- YHWH's people will:
	- learn the difference between the holy and common
	- discern between the unclean and the clean
	- will be judged according to YHWH's ordinances
	- will keep YHWH's laws
	- will keep YHWH's statues regarding the Appointed Feasts
	- will keep YHWH's Sabbath's holy
## **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark>**:
- Appointed [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Feast\|Feast]]s have appointed times.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/SabbathS\|SabbathS]] have appointed times.
- **Important Note**: Ezekiel 44 describes priestly duties in a highly detailed temple that has never yet existed in history. Faithful Christians disagree on its timing: some expect a literal future fulfillment during Christ’s millennial reign, while most others see it as symbolic prophecy already fulfilled in Jesus and His church.

## **<mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">Why</mark>**:

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet. 
- Ezekiel doesn't refer to anyone as a "Jew" the closest equivalent would be the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Jacob\|House of Jacob]]. In Ezekiel 37 joins the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]] and the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Israel\|House of Israel]] back into one nation. 
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- It is generally believed Ezekiel 44 describes priestly duties in a highly detailed temple **that has never yet existed** in history. 
- How does the thought Jesus replaced the Sabbath reconcile with Christians believing it is either a literal future fulfillment during the Christ’s millennial reign OR a symbolic prophecy already fulfilled in Jesus and His church?
	- If it is a future event occurring during the millennial reign, Jesus would have only replaced the Sabbath for a specific period of time, however, it is clearly brought back. 
	- If it is prophecy already fulfilled in Jesus and His church and Jesus replaced the Sabbath - why is the Sabbath still being kept in Ezekiel's prophecy?

## Other Notes:
- Being addressed outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/T/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/C/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]] 
- Exists in the future - after the Messiah comes
- Revelation 21–22 clearly borrows imagery from Ezekiel 40–48 (the city gates named after the 12 tribes, the river of life, the tree of life, no more curse, God’s glory as the light), but John presents this as still future.
