The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..

# Scripture: [Hosea 2:11 (13)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%202%3A11-13&version=TLV;OJB;WEB) 

###### v10 
Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one will deliver her out of my hand. 

###### v11

I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, about which she has said, 'These are my wages that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest,' and the animals of the field shall eat them. 
## **Define**: 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Feast\|Feast]] - the three pilgrimage feasts where all males had to go up to Jerusalem
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/New Moon\|New Moon]] - new moon (the day the lunar month begins)
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/SabbathS\|SabbathS]] - seventh-day Sabbath every week + the special annual Sabbaths
- Solemn Assemblies = [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]] - divinely fixed sacred times when YHWH “meets” with His people
## **<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Who</mark>**:
-  YHWH
- Her - [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Israel\|House of Israel]]

## **<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">What</mark>**: 
- YHWH will cause celebrations to cease (as a consequence of having other lovers)
	- her feasts
	- her new moons
	- her sabbaths
	- her solemn assemblies
#### Note: Based on previous context, Israel credits her festivals and prosperity to “lovers” (false gods) (v12), then even YHWH-named days become functionally idolatrous. Scripture treats misattributed worship as no longer belonging to YHWH. Also Israel created alternative festivals (1 Kings 12:32–33) that look legitimate but were not on the day YHWH appointed nor observed in the way he desired. They are not condemned because feasts are evil, but because they are no longer faithful expressions of allegiance to YHWH.
## **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark>**:
- Cause to cease - in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel”
(Hosea 1:1)

## **<mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">Why</mark>**: 
- The House of Judah was worshipping another god, had corrupted YHWH's appointed times, and had created her own festivals. 

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
-  The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet. 
- Hosea doesn't refer to anyone as a "Jew" the closest equivalent would be the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]]. 
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- Spoke about outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/T/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/C/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]]
- There are two forms of thought here, either way YHWH disapproves:
	- This is not referring to YHWH's appointed times but festivals established by the House of Judah, thus why they are referred to as "hers". 
	- They are referring to YHWH's appointed times but the House of Judah had corrupted them by doing them on days established by her, ways established by her, or worshipping other gods on them.
- Removal or ceasing of YHWH's appointed times is always in reference to a punishment or consequence:
	- The Bible elsewhere defines exile as the time when appointed worship cannot be kept (Leviticus 26:34, Psalm 137:4). "Cause to cease" is not prohibition—it is impossibility due to removal from the land and sanctuary.
	- It wasn't permanent: “Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek YHWH their God, and David their king…” (Hosea 3:5)
