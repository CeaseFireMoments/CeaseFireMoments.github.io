The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..

## **Define**: 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Sign/Sign\|Sign]] = OT אוֹת
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/SabbathS\|SabbathS]] = [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]]
- "Name's sake" - [[Gate of Wisdom/N/Name\|Name]] In biblical thought, God’s “name” is virtually identical with His revealed character, His glory, His holiness, and His presence. To act “for the sake of His name” means to act so that His reputation, holiness, and glory will not be profaned among the nations. Exod-32#v12
- To the end - in order that, so that
- Idioms:
	- for a sign between Me and between you” A visible covenant marker/token that testifies to the relationship (like a wedding ring or national flag)
	- “My eye had pity on them from destroying them” Anthropomorphic idiom: God “spared” or “relented” out of compassion (the eye “pities” instead of looking in wrath)
	- “I withdrew My hand” Idiomatic for “I held back from striking / I refrained from carrying out judgment”
	- “I lifted My hand to them” Standard oath formula = “I swore to them” (raising the hand to heaven when taking an oath)
	- “statutes not good and judgments by which they could not live” judicially handed them over: God “gave them over” to the cruel, death-dealing laws of the pagans. 
	- “in their causing to pass through every opener of the womb” Standard biblical idiom for child sacrifice. God’s holy law commanded that every firstborn belong to Him and be redeemed . The nations’ “statute” was that the firstborn must be killed and burned.
	- “that I might devastate / make them desolate / appall them” To fill them with horror and desolate shock at the consequences of their sin (so they finally recognize Yahweh)

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":

## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet.

## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:

- Read down through the "Why" section, notice the progression? 
	- So that they might know:
		- "I am YHWH who sanctifies them"
		- "I am YHWH your god."
		- "I am YHWH"
	- Consequences:
		- withheld consequences
