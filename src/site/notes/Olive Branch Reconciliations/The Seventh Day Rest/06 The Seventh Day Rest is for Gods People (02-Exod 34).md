The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture:  - Exodus 34:21

"<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Six days</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">work</mark>, but <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the seventh day</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">rest</mark>: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">in plowing time and in harvest </mark><mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">rest</mark>. 

## **Define**: 
- None.
## **Who**:
- Moses - Moses is up on the mountain with Yah-God.
- You - In Hebrew, pronouns can be singular or plural, and the context determines the referent. 
	- The commands shift to plural in Hebrew (e.g., "you" in v. 18 is plural in the Hebrew text, addressing Israel as a collective). The you in v 21 is plural.
	- In v 29 it switches back to a singular you, referencing Moses. 

## **What**: 
- Six days work
- Seventh day rest
## **When**:
- In plowing and harvest time:

## **Why**: 
- Back in verses 10-11 Yah-God says:
	- I am cutting a [[Zunpublished/Covenant\|covenant]]. Before all the people I will do wonders
	- All the people you //Moses// are among will see the work of God. 
	- Obey all that I am commanding you //Moses//
