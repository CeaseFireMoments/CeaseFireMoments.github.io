The Seventh-Day rest—a call to cease—remains one of the Bible’s most disputed and divisive themes. In a world—and a assembly of believers —accustomed to constant striving, the seventh day still asks a disruptive question: What does it mean to stop because YHWH/God said to?

The Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] or Shabbat), sits at the crossroads of devotion, doctrine, and dispute. For some, it is a creation-rooted rhythm meant for all humanity; for others, a covenant sign given uniquely to Israel; for many Christians, a shadow fulfilled and set aside in Christ. Pastors, theologians, rabbis, historians, and everyday believers often speak past one another, each convinced the matter is settled—yet rarely at peace about it.

This series approaches the Seventh Day Rest as a ceasefire moment: a pause not only from labor, but from inherited assumptions and theological hostilities. Rather than beginning with denominational conclusions, we begin where Scripture begins—listening carefully from Genesis to Revelation. The aim is not to win an argument, but to quiet the noise long enough to let the biblical text speak for itself, and to see whether the call to rest has always been less about identity markers and more about trusting YHWH’s word, submitting to His authority, remembering His works, and entering the rest He Himself sanctified..

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
- Anyone who wants YHWH to be their god and who wants to follow Him keeps it. If they do not, there are consequences and punishments.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet. It does not belong to Judaism.
- The Jews who are descendant of Judah all kept it, but YHWH makes it clear it is his and does not belong to man.
- YHWH instituted it for the Israelites and any foreigner who want to be a follower of YHWH. He expects them to keep it His way, not doing so is an abomination.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- The Seventh Day rest is spoke of and commanded several times outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/T/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/C/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]].
- The Seventh Day will exist and be observed in the future Kingdom to come.
