The Meme above is being circulated at a pretty high level so let's explore it, do some critical thinking about its message, and see where we might land afterward. 

# Summary

For those who just want to be told a summary and just want to be spoon fed, here's a summary. But you are THE problem in all of this. Take time to education yourself and THEN make your own decision. The only 100% wrong stance is one made on ignorance. This includes ignorance of why the other side has the opinion they do. 

## 1940 US Army
- a formal, state-controlled military institution under the direction of a duly elected President by 55% of the country
- driven by national and world interests with no ideological alignment to socialism communism, or anarchism
- was a symbol of national unity and had broad support
- operated under a hierarchy and government oversight
- domestic deployments aimed to restore order
- it engaged in military tactics against another formal, state-controlled military institution

## Modern Day Antifa
- a decentralized, non-state movement of self-identified anarchists, communists, and activists
- lacks formal structure
- operates outside legal frameworks
- methods typically include illegal, destructive activities harming people and businesses who are not participating in oppositional activities
- lacks broad societal support and operates as a fringe movement
- the 1940s anti-fascist groups share ideological ties to modern day Antifa but were far less destructive
- instigates violence against non-violent opposition

Other than the "non-citizen" issue, it almost seems like the Original Antifa would be protecting communities from Modern Day Antifa more so than the government?

# Setting the Stage in the 1940 US

President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Democrat), was serving his third term (1933-1945), elected to his third term by 55% of the country. The Democrats held the Senate by 38 seats and the House by 105.

A gallon of milk cost $0.52 delivered, gas was $0.18 per gallon, and a new family car cost between $700-$1500. 

The Minimum wage was $0.30/hour and the top profession was a doctor making $4-5k per year. A Farm laborer made $500-$800 per year. 

It took a hour and a half of work at minimum wage to buy 1 gallon of milk. 

The top crime was property, larceny, and theft. The homicide rate was 5/100k. 

In 1943 there was a riot in Detroit triggered by racial tensions over jobs/housing, 34 were killed, and 675 injured. The National Guard of Michigan was dispatched to assist the local police. President Roosevelt called out 6k Federal Army troops to restore order.

Followed shortly by a riot in Harlem triggered by police shooting a black teen, 6 people were killed and there was widespread property damage. 

"Antifa" didn't exist, but there were those who shared in their ideology opposing what was happening in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. They were driven by a mix of socialist, communist, anarchist, and liberal anti-fascist ideologies. They had a formalize structure and organization. 
- Communist Party USA (CPUSA), an explicitly anti-Nazi group: Their tactics included public demonstrations and occasional street confrontations. Their communist ideology was criticized by American conservatives as a threat.
- Socialist Party and Labor Unions who were against capitalism and authoritarianism.
- Jewish and Immigrant Defense Groups who directly opposed pro-Nazi groups through protests, boycotts, and public campaigns, sometimes resulting in physical altercations. 

During the confrontations with these groups, there were scuffles and minor property damage. They usually engaged in directed efforts toward their opposition by disruptive tactics such as picketing and verbal exchanges, typically focused on counter-demonstrations. Fights might break out, but there wasn't any known fatalities nor any focus on random property damage or burning down towns. 

# Setting the Stage in the 2025 US

President Donald J Trump, former Democrat turned Republican is serving his second non-consecutive term, elected to his second term by 49.8% of the country. The Republicans hold the Senate by 8 seats and the House by 7.

A gallon of milk cost $4.17 delivered, gas is $3.20 per gallon, and a new family car cost between $48-48.8k. 

The Minimum wage is $7.25/hour and the top profession is  a doctor making $403k per year. A shampooer makes $30k per year. 

It takes a half an hour of work at minimum wage to buy 1 gallon of milk. In 1940 it took an hour and a half. 

The top crime is  property, larceny, and theft. The homicide rate is 5/100k. Same as in 1940.

In the Los Angeles Riots, President Trump Federalized and deployed 2000 California National Guard troops and 700 US Marines were deployed. The court ruled this was a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. Back in 1943, President Roosevelt sent 6000 troops to Detroit. Detroit would cover only about 30% of LA's area. 

President Trump deployed approximately 800 National Guard troops from DC and Six Republican led states sent 1200 troops to Washington DC addressing crime and unrest. DC would cover approximately half of Detroit's area.

# President Roosevelt and Modern Day [[Sacred Truces/Fascism\|Fascism]]

President Roosevelt was a vocal opponent of fascism and his policies were driven by democratic ideals and crisis management. However, given today's definition of Fascism, he said and took many actions which could have very easily gotten him labeled as a Fascist. And would have most certainly met with Antifa opposition.

President Roosevelt use "fireside chats," on the radio to bypass traditional newspaper gatekeepers and speak directly to Americans. He was often critical of the print media, particularly newspaper publishers, whom he viewed as largely conservative and aligned with business interests opposed to his policies. He believed many newspapers distorted facts or pushed biased narratives. A 1938 Gallup poll showed that 60% of newspaper editorials opposed his policies. In a 1936 speech, he accused some newspapers of "deliberate misrepresentation" and urged the public to question media motives. However, he maintained a friendly rapport with reports. He once remarked that the press was "90% friendly" but could be "100% wrong" in its interpretations. 

In a 1933, press conference, he said, “The primary duty of maintaining order lies with the states, and the federal government steps in only when states cannot or will not act”. In 1941, he sent federal troops to take control of the North American Aviation plant in California after a strike disrupted aircraft production, stating, “The government cannot allow interference with the war effort”. He placed coal mines under federal control in 1943, to prevent strikes from halting fuel production, justified by national security. 

After Pearl Harbor, he supported military oversight of the internment of approximately 120,000 Japanese-Americans.

During WWII, President Roosevelt's administration implemented censorship through the Office of Censorship to monitored media and communications to prevent leaks of military information. 

His Office of War also produced propaganda to boost morale and support war efforts, sometimes exaggerating or controlling narratives.

He expanded the FBI’s role under J. Edgar Hoover to monitor domestic groups, including the Communist Party USA, socialist organizations, and even some labor unions, due to fears of subversion. This included wiretapping and informant networks, often without clear evidence of criminal activity. The 1940 Smith Act, signed by him, targeted subversive groups, including communists, though it was sparingly used.

He proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint additional justices to shift the court’s balance. 

# Setting the Stage in the 1940 World

The German Reich led by Adolf Hitler seized control of Germany in 1933. Chancellor Hitler banned opposition parties, dissolved trade unions, took control of the media, education, and the judiciary systems.

In 1935, Chancellor Hitler enacted the Nuremberg Laws defining a citizen as a person of "German or related blood," e.g., three or more non-German grandparents.  It did not matter if someone was born in Germany or not. The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor also prohibited marriages and sexual relations between Germans and Non-Germans. This significantly impacted groups of Jewish (~505,000) and Roma (Sinti and Romani) (~25,000) descent. 

Internationally, the German Reich became known as the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi). Thus the reference to Nazi Germany.

In 1940, Nazi Germany launched the Blitzkrieg, invading Denmark and Norway, followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France.

They expanded the Ghettos (segregation areas) and forced Non-German labor. Aggressively enforcing the Nuremberg Laws, stripping any non-German of citizenship and rights.

Prime Minister Benito Mussolini suppressed the political opposition, censored media, and Socialist and Communist activities were aggressively suppressed. The National Fascist Party produced  propaganda through posters, statues, and media.
- They portrayed him as the infallible leader, heroic figure, and emphasized his role as a warrior-leader. 
- Mandatory paramilitary training and school curriculum was instituted. 
- Massive rallies and celebrations where organized aimed at creating a collective Italian pride.
- Communist and opponents were labeled as threats and enemies of the state.

Prime Minister Mussolini  declared war on France and Britain, then invaded Greece. 

The bombing of British cities began and the Axis Power was formed by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Germany wanted to expand across Europe. Italy wanted to restore the Roman Empire across Africa and the Mediterranean. And Japan wanted to dominate Asia and the Pacific. 

# "Antifa"

The first major Antifaschistische Aktion (Antifa) activity was in 1932 in Berlin, by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) whose goal was to unite the communists and socialists against the rising Nazi threat. They utilized direct confrontation, street actions, self-defense networks, and protecting communities from Nazi Germany actions which included: 
- Controlling communities and seizing property, and forcing removal of individuals or families from their homes. Often targeting political opponents, the communist and socialists. 
- Using physical attacks, street brawls, and targeted assaults against political rivals, Non-Germans, and other perceived enemies.
- Targeting Jewish businesses and individuals with vandalism, beatings, and intimidation.
- Assassinating or injuring prominent leftist leaders and activists.
- Using violence to disrupting rival political events. 

# 1940s "Antifa"

According to the graphic, the 1940 version of Antifa was the US Army.

Up until 1940, the US Army was a small peacetime force. They were on stand by for potential emergencies such as natural disasters and major civil disturbances. 

However, due to the world events, the US sought to strength it beginning by instituting the Selective Training and Service Act. The Army began training for joint operations with their Allies. 

The US remained neutral under the Neutrality Acts, providing indirect aid to Allies until after Pearl Harbor in 1941. 

The first major US ground offensive against Nazi German was in 1942 in Morocco and Algeria. 

The US Army played a pivotal role in the Allied success against the Axis powers.  

# President Trump and 1940 Fascism

President Trump although very critical and hyperbolical regarding his opposition parties, has not banned them. 

He has the rank and file union member support at 40-50% but lacks the union leadership support. He won about 44% of union household voters. He has made no moves to dissolve them. 

He has not taken control of the media, although is very critical toward them, echoing much of President Roosevelts sentiments. 

He is disbanding the US Department of Education, moving some aspects to different departments and retuning other aspects to the control of the states. This would be in direct opposition to what the Nazi's did in 1940.  

The Judiciary systems has been oppositional to President Trump's Administration. President Trump has in turn been very aggressive in his public attacks. There have been over 186 lawsuits and more than 50 nationwide injunctions issued. Many related to Immigration, Citizenship, and Firing of Federal Employees. The Supreme court has found in his favor in 60% of the cases which have come before them. President Roosevelt faced over 100 lawsuits with 10-20 injunctions. Its difficult to get an exact number as records focus on landmark outcomes rather than every filing. The Supreme court found in his favor in 53% of the cases which came before them. He served three terms with the Supreme court starting out as a Conservative majority and transition to a Liberal majority in his third term.

Chancellor Hitler enacted the Nuremberg laws defining a citizen. Many equate President Trump's stance on the Birthright Citizenship to this. However, the focus of this is whether babies born in the US where neither of the parents have US Citizenship should be granted Citizenship. This is mainly related to those who are temporary visitors and illegal aliens who come to the US pregnant and give birth. Unlike Adolf Hitler, he isn't taking Citizenship from people who previously held said Citizenship because they have three or more non-American grandparents. There have been no moves to prohibit marriages and sexual relations between American's and non-Americans. He himself is married to a legal immigrant. 

President Trump has not made any invasions into any other countries in order to expand the United States. He has however, made comments regarding Mexico, Canada, and Greenland becoming states. In fact, he has facilitated 6-7 peace agreements or ceasefires. 

There have been no moves in regard to paramilitary training nor school curriculum other than moves toward returning the right of the States to drive curriculum at a state level.

The Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement has informally portrayed him as an infallible leader and heroic figure as Prime Minister Mussolini's propaganda wing did. However, these are not being produced by his party but by his voters. 

Massive rallies and celebrations have been organized and centered around "the MAGA movement" creating an American Pride. It should be noted the base of this movement has a natural affinity to American Pride which existed long before the MAGA movement. 

No General Population American Citizens are purposefully being targeted and forcefully removed from their homes and property seized. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are conduction swept to locate illegal aliens, those with temporary protections, and individuals with criminal records. 

# 2025 "Antifa"

The first modern day "Antifia" movement is typically pin pointed to a left-wing group of self identified anarchists and communists against the neo-Nazi skinheads recruiting at a punk rock concert back in 1987-1988. They used tactics like doxxing, street confrontations, and disrupting rallies.

The first official group was the Rose City Antifa originating in Portland, OR in 2007. 

The modern day prominence of Antifa sparked during the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally in 2017.
- The Protest was organized primarily to protest the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.


- August 11, Torchlight March: Hundreds of people carried tiki torches through the University of Virginia chanting slogans like “Jews will not replace us” and “Blood and soil.” They were confronted and minor  altercations occurred. 
- August 12, Unite the Right Rally
	- Groups like the Alt-Right - the core organizers, Neo-Nazis (National Socialist Movement), Vanguard America, and Ku Klux Klan (Loyal White Knights), Rise Above Movement (RAM), White Lives Matter, gathered with shields, flags, and weapons.
	- A diverse coalition of counter-protesters assembled, including Antifa, Black Lives Matter, Charlottesville Clergy Collective, NAACP, Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ), other local civil right activists and local residents. The counter-protesters engaged in physical confrontations with rallygoers, using fists, sticks, and pepper spray. 
	- James Alex Fields Jr., drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 1 and injuring 35 others.
		- Fields used platforms like Facebook and 8chan to post neo-Nazi symbols, memes, and content praising Adolf Hitler and Nazi policies,
		- At the Unite the Right rally, Fields marched with Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi group, carrying their shield and chanted slogans like "Blood and Soil"
		- At high school, he wore a swastika belt, drew Nazi symbols everywhere, and wrote a research paper aligning with neo-Nazi ideology.
		- While imprisoned, Fields received letters from white nationalists, including a three-page note thanking him for "your service to our people," confirming ongoing ties to the movement
	- The Virginia Governor mobilized the National Guard to restore order. 

In 2025, Antifa involvement is often self-identified or alleged by authorities, with activities centered on anti-ICE protests amid mass deportation policies.

The mass deportation policies are stated as primarily a response to perceived border security threats, a surge in unauthorized migration during the prior administration, and national security concerns. The stated goal is to deport 1–2 million people annually, targeting illegal aliens, those with temporary protections, and individuals with criminal records.

Antifa activities include:
- Widespread riots
- Clashing with police
- Setting fires, and vandalizing federal buildings.
- Vandalism.
- Shattering windows.
- Destroying businesses.
- Torching police vehicles.
- Graffiti.
- Damaging infrastructure.
- Nightly assaults on the ICE detention center using fireworks.
- Molotov cocktails.
- Gunfire.
- Doxxing agents, perceived far-right activists, law enforcement, or political figures. 
- Storming ICE and Detention facilities, firing shots and fireworks at officers.
- Anti-Trump demonstrations with Antifa flags.
- Firebombing.
- Using improvised weapons like pipes, bats, or pepper spray.
- Employing guns, edged weapons, or gasoline jars.

# Original Antifa vs Modern Antifa

The 1932 Antifa organized to PROTECT communities FROM actions which included: 

- physical attacks, street brawls, and targeted assaults against political rivals, Non-Germans, and other perceived enemies
- targeting of businesses and individuals with vandalism, beatings, and intimidation
- assassination or injuring prominent leaders and activists.
- use of violence to disrupting political events

Other than the "non-citizen" issue, it almost seems like the Original Antifa would be protecting communities from Modern Day Antifa more so than the government?
