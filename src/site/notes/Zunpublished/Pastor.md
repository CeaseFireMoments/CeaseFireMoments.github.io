See [[Zunpublished/shepherd\|shepherd]]. 

The concept of a spiritual "pastor" as a shepherd-leader is thoroughly biblical (rooted in the metaphor of tending God's flock), but the English word "pastor" itself is a translational choice in older versions like the KJV, primarily for words that literally mean "shepherd." Modern translations prefer "shepherd" for consistency.
