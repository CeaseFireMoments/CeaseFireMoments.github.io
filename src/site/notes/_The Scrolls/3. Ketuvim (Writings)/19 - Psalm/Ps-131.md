# Psalm 131

[[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-130\|← Psalm 130]] | [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Psalm\|Psalm]] | [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-132\|Psalm 132 →]]
***



###### v1 
Yahweh, my heart isn't arrogant, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me. 

###### v2 
Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me. 

###### v3 
Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forward and forever more.
