# Psalm 133

[[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-132\|← Psalm 132]] | [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Psalm\|Psalm]] | [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-134\|Psalm 134 →]]
***



###### v1 
See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity! 

###### v2 
It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron's beard, that came down on the edge of his robes, 

###### v3 
like the dew of Hermon, that comes down on the hills of Zion; for there Yahweh gives the blessing, even life forever more.
