###### v1 
Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say, 

###### v2 
many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me. 

###### v3 
The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long. 

###### v4 
Yahweh is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked. 

###### v5 
Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who hate Zion. 

###### v6 
Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up, 

###### v7 
with which the reaper doesn't fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom. 

###### v8 
Neither do those who go by say, "The blessing of Yahweh be on you. We bless you in Yahweh's name."
