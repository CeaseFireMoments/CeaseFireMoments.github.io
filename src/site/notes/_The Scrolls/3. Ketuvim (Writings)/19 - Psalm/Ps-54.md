###### v1 
Save me, God, by your name. Vindicate me in your might. 

###### v2 
Hear my prayer, God. Listen to the words of my mouth. 

###### v3 
For strangers have risen up against me. Violent men have sought after my soul. They haven't set God before them. Selah. 

###### v4 
Behold, God is my helper. The Lord is the one who sustains my soul. 

###### v5 
He will repay the evil to my enemies. Destroy them in your truth. 

###### v6 
With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you. I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good. 

###### v7 
For he has delivered me out of all trouble. My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.
