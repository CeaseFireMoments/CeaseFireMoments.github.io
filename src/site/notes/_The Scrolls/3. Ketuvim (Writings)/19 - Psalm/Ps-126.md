***



###### v1 
When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion, we were like those who dream. 

###### v2 
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, "Yahweh has done great things for them." 

###### v3 
Yahweh has done great things for us, and we are glad. 

###### v4 
Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev. 

###### v5 
Those who sow in tears will reap in joy. 

###### v6 
He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
