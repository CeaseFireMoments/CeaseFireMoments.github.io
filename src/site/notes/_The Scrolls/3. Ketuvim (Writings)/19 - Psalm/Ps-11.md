###### v1 
In Yahweh, I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain"? 

###### v2 
For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. 

###### v3 
If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do? 

###### v4 
Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men. 

###### v5 
Yahweh examines the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence. 

###### v6 
On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. 

###### v7 
For Yahweh is righteous. He loves righteousness. The upright shall see his face.
