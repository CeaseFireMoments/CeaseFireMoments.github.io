###### v1 
Misery is mine! Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard: There is no cluster of grapes to eat. My soul desires to eat the early fig.[^7] 

###### v2 
The godly man has perished out of the earth, and there is no one upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; every man hunts his brother with a net[^19]. 

###### v3 
Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently. The ruler and judge ask for a bribe; and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul[^18]. Thus they conspire together[^6]. 

###### v4 
The best of them is like a brier[^5]. The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen, even your visitation, has come; now is the time of their confusion[^13]. 

###### v5 
Don't trust in a neighbor. Don't put confidence in a friend. With the woman lying in your embrace, be careful of the words of your mouth! 

###### v6 
For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house. [^17]

###### v7 
But as for me, I will look to Yahweh. I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. 

###### v8 
Don't rejoice against me, my enemy. When I fall, I will arise. When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me. 

###### v9 
I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, because I have sinned against him, until he pleads my case, and executes judgment for me[^15]. He will bring me out to the light. I will see his righteousness. 

###### v10 
Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her who said to me, where is Yahweh your God? Then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame[^4]. Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets. 

###### v11 
A day to build your walls! In that day, he will extend your boundary. 

###### v12 
In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain[^8]. 

###### v13 
Yet the land will be desolate[^16] because of those who dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. 

###### v14 
Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your heritage, who dwell by themselves in a forest, in the middle of fertile pasture land, let them feed; in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 

###### v15 
"As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt[^9], I will show them marvelous things." [^11]

###### v16 
The nations will see and be ashamed[^14] of all their might. They will lay their hand on their mouth[^3]. Their ears will be deaf. 

###### v17 
They will lick the dust like a serpent[^2]. Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens. They will come with fear to Yahweh our God, and will be afraid because of you. 

###### v18 
Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity, and passes over[^12] the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? He doesn't retain his anger forever, because he delights in loving kindness. 

###### v19 
He will again have compassion on us. He will tread our iniquities under foot; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. [^1]

###### v20 
You will give truth to Jacob, and mercy to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.[^10]
