###### v1 
Listen now to what Yahweh says: "Arise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear what you have to say. 

###### v2 
Hear, you mountains[^9], Yahweh's indictment, and you enduring foundations of the earth[^7]; for Yahweh has a case against his people[^11], and he will contend with Israel. 

###### v3 
My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me! 

###### v4 
For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage[^10]. I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 

###### v5 
My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh." 

###### v6 
How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? [^8]

###### v7 
Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams? With tens of thousands of rivers of oil[^5]? Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience[^6]? The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 

###### v8 
He has shown you, O man, what is good. What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God? [^1]

###### v9 
Yahweh's voice calls to the city, and wisdom sees your name: "Listen to the rod, and he who appointed it. 

###### v10 
Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked[^4], and a short ephah[^14] that is accursed? 

###### v11 
Shall I be pure[^3] with dishonest scales, and with a bag of deceitful weights?[^13] 

###### v12 
Her rich men are full of violence, her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their speech[^12]. 

###### v13 
Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound. I have made you desolate because of your sins. 

###### v14 
You shall eat, but not be satisfied. Your humiliation will be within you. You will store up, but not save; and that which you save I will give up to the sword. 

###### v15 
You will sow, but won't reap. You will tread the olives, but won't anoint yourself with oil; and crush grapes, but won't drink the wine. 

###### v16 
For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of Ahab's house[^2]. You walk in their counsels, that I may make you a ruin, and her inhabitants a hissing; And you will bear the reproach of my people."
