"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If anyone sins unintentionally, in any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and does any one of them,

# Outline

4 And Jehovah speaketh 
	unto Moses, saying,
		`Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, 
			When a person doth sin 
				through *Bishgaga /ignorance 
				against any of the commands [[The Command\|The Command]] of Jehovah regarding things 
					which are not to be done, 
					and hath done [something] against one of these -- [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Sin Offering\|Sin Offering]]

# Priest Sins 
If the priest 
	who is anointed 
	doth sin 
		according to the guilt of the people, :{//bringing guilt on the people  לְאַשְׁמַת הָעָם (le-ashmat ha-am)//:(style="color:#ff00ffff"):}:
	then he hath brought near 
		for his sin which he hath sinned 
		a bullock, 
			a son of the herd, 
			a perfect one, 
		to Jehovah, 
		for a sin-offering,
		and he hath brought in the bullock 
			unto the opening 
				of the tent of meeting 
			before Jehovah, 
		and hath laid his hand on the head of the bullock, 
		and hath slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah.
		And the priest who is anointed hath taken of the blood of the bullock, 
			and hath brought it in unto the tent of meeting,
			and the priest hath dipped his finger in the blood, 
			and sprinkled of the blood seven times before Jehovah, 
				at the front of the vail of the sanctuary; //Most Set\-Apart Place Veil [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Most Set Apart Place/Veil\|Veil]]//
				and the priest hath put of the blood on the horns of the altar of spice-perfume //Golden Alter of Incense [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Set Apart Place/Golden Altar of Incense\|Golden Altar of Incense]]//
					before Jehovah, 
					which \[is\] in the tent of meeting, 
				and all theblood of the bullock he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, //Bronze Altar [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Outer Court/Bronze Altar\|Bronze Altar]]//
					which \[is\] at the opening of the tent of meeting.
		`And all the fat of the bullock 
			of the sin-offering 
			he doth lift up from it, 
				the fat which is covering over the inwards, 
				and all the fat which [is] on the inwards,
				and the two kidneys, 
				and the fat which [is] on them, 
					which [is] on the flanks, 
				and the redundance above the liver, 
					(beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside),
				as it is lifted up from the ox of the sacrifice of the [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Fellowship Offering\|Fellowship Offering]]; 
				and the priest hath made them a perfume 
					on the altar of the burnt-offering. //Bronze Altar [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Outer Court/Bronze Altar\|Bronze Altar]]//
		`And the skin of the bullock, 
			and all its flesh, 
				besides its head, 
				and besides its legs, 
				and its inwards, 
				and its dung --
			he hath even brought out the whole bullock 
				unto the outside of the camp,  //Outside the Camp [[The Camp/Outside\|The Camp/Outside]]//
				unto a clean place, 
				unto the place of the pouring out of the ashes, 
				and he hath burnt it on the wood with fire; 
				beside the place of the pouring out of the ashes it is burnt.

## Congregation Sin
And if the whole company of Israel 
	err ignorantly, 
	and the thing hath been hidden 
		from the eyes of the assembly, 
	and they have done [something against] one of all the commands [[The Command\|The Command]]  
		of Jehovah [concerning things] 
		which are not to be done, 
		and have been guilty;
	when the sin which they have sinned concerning it hath been known, 
	then have the assembly 
		brought near a bullock, 
			a son of the herd, 
			for a sin-offering, 
			and they have brought it in 
				before the tent of meeting;
	and **the elders** of the company 
		have laid their hands on the head of the bullock, 
			before Jehovah, 
		and [one] hath slaughtered the bullock 
			before Jehovah.
	And **the priest** 
		who is anointed 
		hath brought in of the blood of the bullock 
			unto the tent of meeting,
		and the priest hath dipped his finger in the blood, 
			and hath sprinkled seven times 
				before Jehovah 
			at the front of the vail,
			and [some] of the blood he doth put on the horns of the altar 
				which [is] before Jehovah, 
				which [is] in the tent of meeting; 
			and all the blood he doth pour out 
				at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, 
					which [is] at the opening of the tent of meeting;
			and all its fat he doth lift up from it, 
				and hath made perfume on the altar.
			And he hath done to the bullock 
				as he hath done to the bullock of the sin-offering, 
				so he doth to it; 
			and the priest hath made [[Gate of Wisdom/Good News/Atonement\|Atonement]] for them, 
				and it hath been forgiven them;
			and he hath brought out the bullock 
				unto the outside of the camp, 
				and hath burned it 
					as he hath burned the first bullock; 
				it \[is\] a sin-offering of the assembly.
				
#### No Peace Offering [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Fellowship Offering\|Fellowship Offering]] like when the Priest sinned

# Prince (Leader) Sin
\`When a prince doth sin, translated as "leader," "ruler," or "prince" יֶחֱטָא (yecheta)
	and hath done [something against] one of all the commands 
		of Jehovah 
			his God [regarding things] 
		which are not to be done, 
		through ignorance, 
		and hath been guilty --
			or his sin wherein he hath sinned hath been made known unto him, 
	then he hath brought in his offering, 
		a kid of the goats, 
			a male, 
			a perfect one,
		and he hath laid his hand on the head of the goat, 
		and hath slaughtered it 
			in the place where he doth slaughter the burnt-offering 
				before Jehovah; 
				it [is] a sin-offering.
	And the priest 
		hath taken of the blood 
			of the sin-offering 
			with his finger, 
			and hath put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, 
			and its blood he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering,
		and with all its fat 
			he doth make perfume 
				on the altar, 
				as the fat of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; 
		and the priest hath made atonement [[Gate of Wisdom/Good News/Atonement\|Atonement]] , Ransom [[Gate of Wisdom/Ransom\|Ransom]] for him 
			because of his sin, 
			and it hath been forgiven him.

##### atonement is a made up word by Tyndale - at one ment - reconcillation, reintegration of relationships - making them one again. However, the weekness of this is that the priest does the kipper and then the forgivenss is done directly by God and that is what completes it - the atonement isn’t done until God has forgiven. The priest is not doing the whole of the reconcilation, he’s fulfilling a pre-requisite. He is removing an impediment to the devine - human relationship. 

# Common people Sins

`And if any person of the people 
	of the land sin 
	through ignorance, 
	by his doing [something against] one of the commands ([[The Command\|The Command]] 
		of Jehovah [regarding things] 
		which are not to be done, 
		and hath been guilty --
		or his sin which he hath sinned 
			hath been made known unto him, 
	then he hath brought in his offering, 
		a kid of the goats, 
			a perfect one, 
			a female, 
		for his sin which he hath sinned,
	and he hath laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, 
	and hath slaughtered the sin-offering 
		in the place of the burnt-offering.
	And the priest 
		hath taken of its blood with his finger, 
			and hath put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, 
		and all its blood he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar
		and all its fat he doth turn aside, 
			as the fat hath been turned aside 
				from off the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, 
		and the priest hath made perfume on the altar, 
			for sweet fragrance 
				to Jehovah; 
		and the priest 
			hath made atonement for him, 
			and it hath been forgiven him.
	And if he bring in a sheep [for] his offering, 
		for a sin-offering, 
			a female, 
			a perfect one, 
			he doth bring in,
		and he hath laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, 
		and hath slaughtered it for a sin-offering 
			in the place where he slaughtereth the burnt-offering.
	And the priest 
		hath taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, 
			and hath put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, 
		and all its blood he poureth out at the foundation of the altar,
		and all its fat he turneth aside, 
			as the fat of the sheep is turned aside from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, 
			and the priest hath made them a perfume 
				on the altar, 
			according to the fire-offerings 
				of Jehovah, 
		and the priest hath made atonement for him, 
			for his sin which he hath sinned, 
			and it hath been forgiven him.

##### All the other’s bring a male, but the common person brings a female
