###### v5 
He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, "Who are these with you?" He said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."

###### v7

###### v9 
Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours." 

###### v10 
Jacob said, "Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God[^1], and you were pleased with me. 

###### v11 
Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me[^3], and because I have enough." He urged him, and he took it.
