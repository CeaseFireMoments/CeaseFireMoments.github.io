	- Abraham's son, 
	- whom Hagar 
		- the Egyptian, 
		- Sarah's servant, 
		- bore to Abraham.

	- They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives. 
#### a wide territory in the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding areas.

## Isaac

- This is the history of the generations of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Isaac\|Isaac]], 
	- Abraham's son. 
	- Abraham became the father of Isaac. 
	- Isaac was forty years old 
		- when he took [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Rebekah\|Rebekah]], to be his wife. 
			- the daughter of Bethuel 
				- the Syrian 
					- of Paddan Aram, 
			- the sister of Laban 
				- the Syrian
		Isaac entreated Yahweh 
		- for his wife, 
		- because she was barren. 
		- Yahweh was entreated by him, 
			- and Rebekah his wife conceived. 
				- The children struggled together within her. 
				- She said, "If it is like this, why do I live?" 
					- She went to inquire of Yahweh. 
						- Yahweh said to her, 
							- "Two nations //[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]] and [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Edomites\|Edomites]]// are in your womb. 
							- Two peoples will be separated from your body. 
							- The one people will be stronger than the other people. 
							- The elder //[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Esau\|Esau]]// will serve the younger //[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Jacob\|Jacob]]//." 
						- When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
							- The first 
								- came out red all over, 
								- like a hairy garment. 
								- They named him [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Esau\|Esau]]. 
							- After that, his brother came out, 
								- and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. 
								- He was named [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Jacob\|Jacob]]. 
						- Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them. 
The boys grew. 
## Esau
- The first came out <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">red</mark> all over, 
	- like a hairy garment.  
- Esau was a skillful hunter, 
- a man of the field. 
-  Now Isaac loved Esau, 
	- because he ate his venison. 
## Jacob
- Jacob was a quiet man, 
- living in tents. 
- Rebekah loved Jacob. 
	- Jacob boiled stew. 
## Birthright

- Esau came in 
	- from the field, 
	- and he was famished. 
	- Esau said to Jacob, 	- 
		- "Please feed me 
			- with some of that <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">red</mark> stew, 
				- for I am famished." 
					- Therefore his name was called <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">Edom</mark>. [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-36#v1\|Gen-36:1]]
#### Edom means red. Later this name applies to the region and people descended from him, known as Edom and the Edomites, southeast of the Dead Sea. The Edomites are rivals of the Israelites [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/39 - Malachi/Mal-01#v2\|Mal-01:2]][[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/39 - Malachi/Mal-01#v3\|Mal-01#v3]][[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/39 - Malachi/Mal-01#v4\|-4]]

- 
	- Jacob said, 
		- "First, sell me your birthright."  
	- Esau said, 
		- "Behold, I am about to die. 
			- What good is the [[Gate of Wisdom/Birthright\|Birthright]] to me?"
	- Jacob said, 
		- "Swear to me first." 
			- He //Esau// swore to him //Jacob//. 
			- **He sold his birthright to Jacob**. 
	- Jacob gave Esau 
		- bread 
		- and lentil stew. 
	- He //Esau// 
		- ate 
		- and drank, 
		- rose up, 
		- and went his way. 
		- So Esau despised his birthright. [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/58 - Hebrews/Heb-12#v16\|Heb-12:16]]

#### Despised =  בָּזָה (pronounced "bazah") means "to despise," "to scorn," "to hold in contempt," or "to regard as worthless." 

#### It seems to me Jacob valued the birthright more than Esau - he didn't "deceive" Esau or "trick" him out of it. The deception and trickery came in Jacob working to deceive his father, Isaac.
