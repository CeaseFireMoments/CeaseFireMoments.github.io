#### The earliest biblical example of pouring oil. It foreshadows a practice of anointing objects to dedicate them to God, seen later in the Bible (e.g., Exodus 30:25-29, where oil is used to consecrate tabernacle items). Pouring oil on the stone signifies setting it apart as [[Gate of Wisdom/Holy\|Holy]].

#### Luz (almond or almond tree) renamed Bethel (House of God). This is the first record of a place being renamed.

#### This is the first mention of giving a tenth to Yah. In Genesis 14:20: Abraham gives a tenth of everything to Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of God Most High, after rescuing Lot and receiving a blessing.
