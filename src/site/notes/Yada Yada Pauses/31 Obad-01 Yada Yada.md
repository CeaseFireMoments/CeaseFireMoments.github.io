# Setting
## Who:
- Author: [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Obadiah\|Obadiah]]
- Audience: [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/Edom\|Edom]] (primarily); [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]] (secondarily)
- Bullet list Characters and People Groups: 
	- Edom
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Esau\|Esau]]
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Jacob\|Jacob]]
	- Teman
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Jacob\|House of Jacob]]
	- House of Joseph
	- Nations
## What:
- **Main Storyline:** Vision of judgment against Edom for pride and violence against brother Jacob; their destruction and the restoration of Israel’s possession.
- Edom stood aloof when Jacob (Israel/Judah) was attacked, gloated over their disaster, looted their wealth, and even handed over survivors to the enemy on the day of their calamity. They didn’t just fail to help; they actively profited from and participated in Jacob’s destruction (likely during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 586 BC).
- The specific actions of Edom condemned (gloating, looting, standing at the crossroads to cut down fugitives, handing over survivors) are not narrated in a single historical passage of Scripture. 2 Kings 25 and 2 Chronicles 36 describe the fall of Jerusalem but do not mention Edom. Instead, they are prophetically summarized in Obadiah itself, with parallel echoes and partial historical corroboration in the following passages:
	- [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-137#v7\|Ps-137#v7]] Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said, ‘Lay it bare, lay it bare, down to its foundations!’”
	- [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/25 - Lamentations/Lam-04#v21\|Lam-04#v21]] Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom... The cup shall pass to you as well; you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.
	- [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/26 - Ezekiel/Ezek-35#v1\|Ezek-35#v1]] Because you cherished perpetual enmity and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword...

## When:
- Date Authored: Between 589 and 550 BC (most likely 586–582 BC)
- Date takes place: 586 BC (the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon), with possible aftermath raids 586–582 BC

## Where: 
- Edom, Mount Esau (modern: southern Jordan, including Petra region); Mount Zion (Jerusalem)
