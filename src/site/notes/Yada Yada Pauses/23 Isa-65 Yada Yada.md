# [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Unrighteous\|Unrighteous]]

- "I <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Yah// </mark>am inquired of 
	- by those who didn't ask. 
- I am found by those 
	- who didn't seek me. [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-10#v20\|Rom-10:20]]
- I said, 'See me, see me,' 
	- to a nation 
		- that was not called by my [[Gate of Wisdom/Name\|Name]]. 
- I have spread out my hands all day 
	- to a rebellious people, 
		- who walk in a way 
			- that is not good, 
		- after their own thoughts; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-10#v21\|Rom-10:21]]
	- a people who 
		- provoke me to my face continually, 
			- sacrificing in gardens, 
			- and burning incense on bricks; 
		- who sit among the graves, 
			- and spend nights in secret places; 
			- who eat pig's meat [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/03 - Leviticus/Lev-07#v18\|Lev-07:18]], 
			- and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; 
		- who say, 'Stay by yourself, 
			- don't come near to me, 
				- for I am holier than you.' 
	- These are smoke in my nose, 
		- a fire that burns all day. 

- "Behold, it is written before me: 
	- I will not keep silence, 
		- but will repay, 
			- yes, I will repay 
				- into their bosom, 
				- your own iniquities, 
				- and the iniquities of your fathers together", 
			- says Yahweh, 
				- "who have burned incense on the mountains, 
				- and blasphemed me on the hills. 
		- Therefore I will first measure their work into their bosom." 
- "But you who 
	- forsake Yahweh, 
		- who forget my holy mountain, <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jerusalem//</mark> 
		- who prepare a table for Fortune, 
		- and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny; 
	- I will destine you to 
		- the sword, 
		- and you will all bow down to the slaughter;
	- because 
		- when I called, 
			- you didn't answer. 
		- When I spoke, 
			- you didn't listen; 
		- but you 
			- did that which was evil in my eyes, 
			- and chose that in which I didn't delight." 
	- Therefore the Lord Yahweh says, 
		- you will be hungry;
		- you will be thirsty.
		- you will be disappointed; 
		- you will cry for sorrow of heart, 
		- and will wail for anguish of spirit. 
		- You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen; 
		- and the Lord Yahweh will kill you.
		-  and the sinner being one hundred years old will be accursed

# [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Righteous\|Righteous]]

- Yahweh says, 
	- "As the new wine is found in the cluster, <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//The cluster represents people//</mark>
	- and one says, 
		- 'Don't destroy it, 
			- for a blessing is in it:' 
			- so I will do for my servants' <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//plural// </mark>sake, 
				- that I may not destroy them all. 
	- I will bring offspring //[[Zunpublished/Seed\|Seed]]// 
		- out of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Jacob\|Jacob]], 
			- and out of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Judah\|Judah]]
				- an inheritor of my mountains. 
				- My chosen will inherit it //mountains//, 
					- and my servants will dwell there. 
					- Sharon will be a fold of flocks, 
					- and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, 
						- for my people who have sought me. 
	
- Therefore the Lord Yahweh says, 
	- "Behold, my servants will eat, 
	- my servants will drink, 
	- my servants will rejoice
	- Behold, my servants will sing for joy of heart, 
	- He will call his servants by another name, 
		- so that he who blesses himself in the earth 
			- will bless himself in the God of truth; 
		- and he who swears in the earth 
			- will swear by the God of truth; 
		- because the former troubles are forgotten, 
		- and because they are hidden from my eyes. 
# New Heaven, New Earth, New Jerusalem

- "For, behold, I create 
	- new heavens 
	- and a new earth; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/61 - 2 Peter/2 Pet-03#v13\|2 Pet-03:13]]; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/66 - Revelation/Rev-21#v1\|Rev-21:1]]
	- and the former things 
		- will not be remembered, 
		- nor come into mind. 
	- But be glad and rejoice forever 
		- in that which I create; 
		- for, behold, I create Jerusalem 
			- to be a delight, 
			- and her people a joy.  [[Psalm-48#v2\|Psalm-48:2]]
			- I will rejoice 
				- in Jerusalem, 
				- and delight in my people; 
				- and the voice of weeping 
				- and the voice of crying 
					- will be heard in her no more. 
				- "No more will there be 
					- an infant 
						- who only lives a few days, 
					- nor an old man 
						- who has not filled his days; 
					- for the child will die one hundred years old, 
		- They <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//my servants// </mark>will build houses and inhabit them. 
			- They will not build and another inhabit. 
		- They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 			- 
			- They will not plant and another eat: 
		- for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, 
			- and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.
				- They will not labor in vain 
				- nor give birth for calamity; 
			- for they are the offspring //[[Zunpublished/Seed\|seed]]// 
				- of Yahweh's blessed 
				- and their descendants with them. 
- It will happen that 
	- before they call, 
		- I will answer; 
	- and while they are yet speaking, 
		- I will hear. 

# Peace
 
- The wolf and the lamb will feed together. 
- The lion will eat straw like the ox. 
- Dust will be the serpent's food. [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/27 - Daniel/Dan-12#v2\|Dan-12:2]]
- They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain," says Yahweh.
