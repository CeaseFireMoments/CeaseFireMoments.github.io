- Where do wars and fightings[^3] among you come from? 
	- Don't they come from your pleasures that war in your members? 
		- You lust[^8], 
			- and don't have. 
		- You murder and covet, 
			- and can't obtain. 
		- You fight and make war. 
		- You don't have, 
			- because you don't ask. 
			- You ask, 
				- and don't receive, 
					- because you ask with wrong motives, 
						- so that you may spend it on your pleasures. 
- You adulterers and adulteresses[^7], 
	- don't you know that friendship with the world 
		- is hostility toward God? 
			- Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world 
				- makes himself an enemy of God. 
		- Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, 
			- "The Spirit who lives in us 
				- yearns jealously"?[^2] 
			- But he gives more [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Grace\|Grace]][^4]. 
				- Therefore it says, "God resists the proud, 
					- but gives grace to the humble." 
			- Be subject therefore to God. [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Commands (Mitzvot)\|Commands (Mitzvot)]] 
				- Resist the [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Devil\|Devil]] <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Accuser, slanderer (one who attacks with false or malicious charges)//</mark>,  [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Commands (Mitzvot)\|Commands (Mitzvot)]]
					- and he will flee from you. 
				- Draw near to God, 
					- and he will draw near to you. 
				- Cleanse your hands, 
					- you sinners. 
				- Purify your hearts, [^10]
					- you double-minded. [^1]
				- Lament, mourn, and weep. 
					- Let your laughter be turned to mourning, 
					- and your joy to gloom. 
				- Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord[^9], 
			- and he will exalt you. 
				- Don't speak against one another, [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Judgments (Mishpatim)\|Judgments (Mishpatim)]]
					- brothers. 
					- He who speaks against a brother and [[Gate of Wisdom/Judge\|Judge]] his brother,
						- speaks against the law \\[[Gate of Wisdom/Torah\|Torah]] \\ and judges the law. 
							- But if you judge the law, 
								- you are not a doer of the law, 
									- but a judge. 
			- Only one is the lawgiver, 
				- who is able to 
					- save 
					- and to destroy.
						- But who are you to judge another? 

#### Notice what it says ... The Set-Apart Breath of YHWH (aka Holy Spirit) is INSIDE but there is a war INSIDE. The Holy Spirit WANTS you to listen, yearns for it. Just as YHWH yearned for the love of Israel in the Old Testament. Yah was a jealous god, and now His Set Apart Spirit is a jealous spirit because we follow our OWN pleasures.

#### The Devil - the slander - in this case is our own pleasures, our own desires. 
#### Don't speak against one another - take a stand, bear record against: [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-19#v15\|Deut-19#v15]]-19 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin that he sins. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established. [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-18#v15\|Matt-18#v15]]-20. 

![Matt-1815-20 and Deut-1915-19.png](/img/user/_Assets/attachments/Matt-1815-20%20and%20Deut-1915-19.png)
#### Speak against the law ... Slandering or condemning a brother violates this command → you speak against the law by disobeying it. [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/03 - Leviticus/Lev-19#v16\|Lev-19#v16]]  The law = Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (James 2:8; Leviticus 19:18).  

#### Judge the law ... By condemning your brother, you sit in judgment over him as if you are above the law.  This usurps God’s role as the only Lawgiver and Judge (James 4:12: “There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?”).  You judge the law by acting as if it’s invalid or insufficient — you set yourself above it.
#### Not a doer… but a judge”  Doer = one who obeys the law (James 1:22–25).  Judge = one who critiques or overrides the law.  You cannot obey a law you’ve dethroned.

- Come now, you who say, 
	- "Today or tomorrow 
		- let's go into this city, 
		- and spend a year there, 
			- trade, 
			- and make a profit." 
	- Whereas you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow. 
		- For what is your life? 
		- For you are a vapor that appears 
			- for a little time, 
			- and then vanishes away. 
	- For you ought to say, [^11]
		- "If the Lord wills, 
			- we will both live,
			- and do this or that." 
	- But now you glory 
		- in your boasting[^6]. 
			- All such boasting is evil. 
		- To him therefore who knows to do good, 
			- and doesn't do it, 
				- to him it is sin.[^5]
