# Outline

#### Prologue: [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-04#v13\|Ephes-04:13]][[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-04#v14\|Ephes-04#v14]][[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-04#v15\|-15]]-  We may all come to the unity of faith ... no longer be children ... carried around by every wind of the teaching, cunning men, to the scheming of leading astray ... speak truth in love wo we may increase in him all things who is the head - the Messiah. V 25 For this reason, putting away the lying, each speak truth with his neighbor .. v 28 who ever is stealing, let him no longer steal ... 

### Followers of Yah and Members of Light
- Become, then, <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">//see prologue above//</mark>
	- followers of God, 
		- as children beloved,
		- and walk in love, 
			- as also the Christ did love us, 
			- and did give himself for us, 
				- an offering 
				- and a sacrifice 
					- to God 
						- for an odour of a sweet smell,
		- as becometh saints
			- -- but rather thanksgiving;
		- and now <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">//you are//</mark> light in the Lord; 
			- as children of light walk ye,
				- for the fruit of the Spirit <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">//light see DSC below)//</mark> [is] 
					- in all goodness,
					- and righteousness, 
					- and truth,
					- proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord,
					- and have no fellowship 
						- with the unfruitful works of the darkness 
							- and rather even convict <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">//ἐλέγχω (elenchō)//</mark>
							- and all the things reproved <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">//ἐλέγχω (elenchō)//</mark> by the light 
								- are manifested, 
								- for everything that is manifested is light;
								- wherefore he <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">//the Lord//</mark> saith, 
									- `Arouse thyself, 
										- thou who art sleeping, 
										- and arise out of the dead, 
										- and the Christ shall shine upon thee.'
##### Reproving section sounds just like Colossians 3 [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/51 - Colossians/Col-03\|Col-03]] Bringing order to chaos.
##### Isaiah 26:19 [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-26#v19\|Isa-26:19]] part of a song of trust in God’s salvation, emphasizing hope and restoration. It speaks prophetically of resurrection, where the dead will live again, rising from the dust in a manner likened to dew bringing life. Speaks of a future resurrection of God’s people. 
##### Isaiah 60:1: [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-60#v1\|Isa-60:1]] speaks about a light has come and darkness covering the earth, but nations will come to your light.
<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Because Christ shines upon thee ...//</mark>
- See, then, how exactly ye walk, 
	- not as unwise, 
		- but as wise,
			- redeeming the time, 
				- because the days are evil;
					- because of this /<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">/because the days are evil//</mark> become not fools, 
						- but -- understanding what [is] the will of the Lord,
					- and be not [[drunk\|drunk]] with wine, 
						- in which is dissoluteness, 
						- but be filled in the Spirit,
							- speaking to yourselves in /<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">/speaking to yourself in your heart to the Lord//</mark>
								- psalms 
								- and hymns 
								- and spiritual songs, 
								- singing 
								- and making melody 
									- in your heart to the Lord,,
								- giving thanks always 
									- for all things, 
										- in the name of our Lord 
											- Jesus Christ, 
											- to the God and Father;
								- [[Zunpublished/Subjecting\|Subjecting]] yourselves 
									- to one another 
										- in the fear of God.
									- The wives! 
										- to your own husbands 
											- Subjecting  yourselves, 
												- as to the Lord,

##### [[Zunpublished/Subjecting\|Subjecting]]
##### Having no fellowship with the darkness rather convict it, because all things reproved by the light are manifested - submit to one another for reproving. Isaiah 8:19-20 to the law and to the testimony, if they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
- The wives! 
	- to your own husbands 
		- Subjecting  yourselves, 
			- as to the Lord,
		- because the husband 
			- is head 
				- of the wife, 
			- as also the Christ 
				- head 
					- of the assembly, 
				- saviour of the body,
		- but even as the assembly 
			- is subject to Christ, 
				- so also [are] the wives 
					- to their own husbands 
						- in everything.

##### Literal translation: The wives to their own husbands - for reproving

##### [[1 Cor-4#v32\|1 Cor-4:32]][[1 Cor-4#v33\|1 Cor-4#v33]][[1 Cor-4#v34\|1 Cor-4#v34]][[1 Cor-4#v35\|1 Cor-4#v35]][[1 Cor-4#v36\|-36]] - No explicit command in the Torah to women remaining silent in a community, the closest reference would be [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-03#v16\|Gen-03:16]] about a husband ruling over his wife. Chaos requires order. 
##### Genesis 3:16, Colossians 3 :18, 1 Peter 3 :1-7 about wives being subject to their husbands is in context of the community, teaching and admonishing one another with all wisdom - Bringing order to chaos. 
##### A husband can nullify a wive’s vows and then bear the guilt [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-30\|Num-30]]
##### 1 Timothy 2:8-15 A woman receive training in a quiet demanor with complete respect for order. Paul does not allow a woman to train or dictate to a man because Adam was formed first, and Adam was not deceived but the woman.

- The husbands! 
	- love your own wives, 
		- as also the Christ 
			- did love the assembly, 
			- and did give himself for it,
				- that he might sanctify it, 
				- having cleansed [it] 
					- with the bathing of the water in the saying, <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//the washing of the water; mikveh//</mark>
						- that he might present it 
							- to himself 
					- the assembly in glory, 
						- not having spot 
						- or wrinkle, 
						- or any of such things, 
			- but that it may be 
				- holy <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//set apart//</mark>
				- and unblemished;
			- so ought the husbands to love 
				- their own wives 
					- as their own bodies: 
				- he who is loving his own wife 
					- -- himself he doth love;
						- for no one ever his own flesh did hate, 
							- but doth 
								- nourish 
								- and cherish it, 
					- as also the Lord 
						- -- the assembly,
						- because members we are 
							- of his body, 
							- of his flesh, 
							- and of his bones;
					- for this cause 
						- shall a man leave 
							- his father and mother, 
						- and shall be joined 
							- to his wife, 
						- and they shall be 
							- -- the two 
								- -- for one flesh;'
							- this secret is great, 
								- and I speak in regard to 
									- Christ 
										- and to the assembly;
									- but ye also, 
										- every one in particular 
										- -- let each his own wife 
											- so love as himself, 
										- and the wife 
											- -- that she may reverence
												- the husband.
## Members of Darkness
- become not, then, partakers with them, /<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">/members of darkness//</mark>
	- let it not even be named among you, 
		- and whoredom, 
		- and all uncleanness, 
		- or covetousness, ;
		- also filthiness, 
		- and foolish talking, 
			- or jesting, 
		- -- the things not fit 
	- for this ye know, 
		- that every whoremonger, 
		- or unclean, 
		- or covetous person, 
		- who is an idolater, 
			- hath no inheritance 
				- in the reign 
					- of the Christ and God.
	- Let no one deceive you 
		- with vain words, 
			- for because of these things //characteristics of darkness//
				- cometh the anger of God 
					- upon the sons 
						- of the disobedience,
	- for ye were once darkness, 
	- for the things in secret 
		- done by them 
		- it is a shame even to speak of,
