<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark> [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Isaac\|Isaac]] was old, and his eyes were dim,
- so that he could not see, 
- he called [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Esau\|Esau]] 
	- his elder son, 
	- and said to him, 
		- "My son?" 
			- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Esau//</mark> said to him<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;"> //Isaac/</mark>, 
				- "Here I am." 
	- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Isaac//</mark> said, 
		- "See now, 
			- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">I am old</mark>
			- I don't know the day of my [^1]death. 
		- Now therefore, 
			- please take your weapons,
				- your quiver 
				- and your bow, 
			- and go out to the field, 
				- and get me venison. 
			- Make me savory food, 
				- such as I love, 
			- and bring it to me, 
				- that I may eat, 
				- and <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">that my soul may bless you</mark> 
					- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">before I die</mark>." 
	- Esau went 
		- to the field 
			- to hunt for venison, 
			- and to bring it. 

- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Rebekah\|Rebekah]] heard 
	- when Isaac spoke to Esau 
		- his son. 
	- Rebekah spoke to [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Jacob\|Jacob]] 
		- her son, saying, 
			- "Behold, I heard 
				- your father 
					- speak to Esau 
						- your brother, saying,
							- 'Bring me venison, 
							- and make me savory food, 
								- that I may eat, 
								- and [^5]bless you 
								- <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">before Yahweh</mark> 
									- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">before my death</mark>.' 
			- Now therefore, 
				- my son, 
					- obey my voice 
						- according to that which I command you. 
						- Go now to the flock 
							- and get me two good young goats from there. 
								- I will make them savory food 
									- for your father, 
										- such as he loves.
								- You shall bring it 
									- to your father, 
										- that he may eat, 
											- so that he may bless you 
												- before his death." 
#### Rebekah has indicated this was a command from her. Interesting how the text indicates "his son" and "her son". 

#### Later in v 36 Esau indicates Jacob cheated him twice. First he will get  the [[Gate of Wisdom/Birthright\|Birthright]], Jacob was rightly entitled to that because Esau gave it to him [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v29\|Gen-25:29]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v30\|Gen-25#v30]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v31\|Gen-25#v31]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v32\|Gen-25#v32]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v33\|Gen-25#v33]][[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v34\|-34]]. But because of Rebekah's command, Jacob will also get the [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Blessing\|Blessing]], through deception of Isaac. 

- Jacob said 
	- to Rebekah 
		- his mother, 
		- "Behold, Esau 
			- my brother 
			- is a hairy man, 
				- and I am a smooth man.
				- What if my father touches me? 
					- I will seem to him as a deceiver, 
						- and I would bring a curse on myself, 
							- and not a [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Blessing\|Blessing]]." 

#### Jacob doesn't want to do this, he has a dilemma as to whether to listen to his mother or not. 

- His mother said 
	- to him <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob/</mark>/,
		- "[^2]Let your curse be on me, 
			- my son. 
		- Only obey my voice, 
			- and go get them for me." 
	- He went, 
	- and got them, 
	- and brought them 
		- to his mother. 
	- His mother 
		- made savory food, 
			- such as his father loved. 

#### Eden language - saw/went took, gave

- Rebekah took 
	- the good clothes 
		- of Esau, 
			- her elder son, 
		- which were with her 
			- in the house, 
	- and put them 
		- on Jacob, 
			- her younger son.
	- She put the skins 
		- of the young goats 
			- on his hands, 
			- and on the smooth of his neck. 
	- She gave 
		- the savory food 
		- and the bread, 
			- which she had prepared, 
		- into the hand 
			- of her son 
				- Jacob. 

#### Eden - Yah made clothes for Adam and Eve

- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob//</mark> came 
	- to his father, 
	- and said, 
		- "My father?" 
	- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Isaac//</mark> said,

		- Who are you, my son?"
			- Jacob said

#### Wouldn't Isaac have known about what Yah told Rebekah about the older serving the younger? 
#### Wouldn't Isaac have known about Esau giving his birthright to Jacob?
## The Blessing
- God give you 
	- of the dew 
		- of the sky, 
	- of the fatness 
		- of the earth, 
	- and plenty of grain and new wine. 
- Let peoples <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//ammim (עַמִּים).//</mark>
	- serve you, 
- and nations <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//le’ummim (לְאֻמִּים)//</mark>
	- bow down to you. 
- Be lord over your brothers. 
	- Let your mother's sons bow down to you. 
- [^3]Cursed be everyone 
	- who curses you. 
- [^4]Blessed be everyone 
	- who blesses you." [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-12#v3\|Gen-12:3]]

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">As soon as</mark> Isaac had finished 
- blessing Jacob,
- and Jacob had just gone out 
	- from the presence of Isaac 
		- his father, 
- Esau 
	- his brother 
	- came in from his hunting. 
	- He also made 
		- savory food, 
	- and brought it 
		- to his father. 
	- He said 
		- to his father, 
			- "Let my father arise, 
			- and eat of his son's venison, 
				- that your soul may bless me." 
			- Isaac 
				- his father said 
					- to him, 
						- "Who are you?" 
					- He said, 
						- "I am your son, 
							- your firstborn, 
							- Esau." 

# Deceived

- Isaac trembled violently, and said, 
	- "Who, then, is he who 
		- has taken venison, 
		- and brought it to me, 
		- and I have eaten of all 
			- before you came, 
			- and have blessed him? 
				- Yes, he will be blessed." 

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark> Esau heard the words 
	- of his father, 
	- he cried 
		- with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, 
	- and said to his father, 
		- "Bless me, even me also, my father." 
			- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Isaac//</mark> said, 
				- "Your brother came 
					- with deceit, 
					- and <mark style="background: #94DEA9A6;">has taken away</mark> 
						- your [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Blessing\|Blessing]]."  <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Doesn't say your birthright//</mark>
	- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Esau//</mark> said, 
		- "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? 
			- For he has supplanted me these two times <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//both the birthright and the blessing//</mark>. 
				- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob//</mark> <mark style="background: #94DEA9A6;">took away</mark> my [[Gate of Wisdom/Birthright\|Birthright]]. 
				- See, now he <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob//</mark> has <mark style="background: #94DEA9A6;">taken away</mark> my  [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Blessing\|Blessing]]." 
					- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Esau//</mark> said, 
						- "Haven't you <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Isaac//</mark> reserved a blessing for me?" 
							- Isaac answered Esau, 
								- "Behold, I have made him your lord, 
								- and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. 
								- I have sustained him with grain and new wine.
									 - What then will I do for you, my son?" 
	- Esau said to his father, 
		- "Do you have just one  [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Blessing\|Blessing]], my father? 
			- Bless me, even me also, my father." 
		- Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 
			- Isaac his father answered him, 
				- "Behold, your dwelling will be of the fatness of the earth, 
				- and of the dew of the sky from above. 
				- You will live by your sword, 
				- and you will serve your brother. 
					- It will happen, when 
						- you will break loose, 
							- that you will shake his yoke 
								- from off your neck." 
	- Esau hated Jacob 
		- because of the blessing 
			- with which his father 
				- blessed him. 
		- Esau said in his heart, "
			- [^6]The days of mourning for my father are at hand. 
				- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Then</mark> I will kill my brother Jacob." 


#### Esau didn't get "the name." Was that what he wanted the most? Would everyone know he didn't get the blessing? Would Esau feel shame for not getting "the name"?  
#### In the context of Genesis 27, Isaac’s words to Esau indicate a future where Esau (and his descendants, often associated with Edom in Jewish tradition) will initially be subservient to Jacob (and his descendants, Israel). The "yoke" represents Jacob’s dominance or authority over Esau, likely in a familial or socio-political sense. However, the phrase "when you grow restless" (tarid) suggests that Esau’s submission is not permanent. At some point, through striving or rebellion, Esau will "break loose" and cast off Jacob’s yoke, achieving independence or freedom from this subjugation. The Hebrew wording implies a struggle or effort (rud suggests active resistance or restlessness) rather than a passive release. The imagery of breaking a yoke is vivid in the Hebrew Bible, symbolizing liberation from oppression (e.g., Isaiah 9:4, Jeremiah 28:2). Thus, Isaac’s prophecy foretells a time when Esau’s descendants will assert their autonomy, no longer under Jacob’s control.
# Sent Away
- The words of Esau, 
	- her elder son, 
	- were told to Rebekah. 
		- She sent and called Jacob, 
			- her younger son, 
			- and said to him, 
				- "Behold, your brother Esau 
					- comforts himself about you 
						- by planning to kill you. 
							- Now therefore, my son, 
								- obey my voice. 
									- <mark style="background: #94DEA9A6;">Arise, flee to Laban</mark>, 
										- my brother, 
										- in Haran. <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//northeast from Canaan//</mark>
										- Stay with him a few days, 
											- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">until</mark> your brother's fury turns away-- 
											- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">until</mark>  your brother's anger turns away from you, 
											- and he forgets what you have done to him. 
												- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Then</mark> I will send, 
												- and get you from there.
													- Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?" 
	- Rebekah said to Isaac, 
		- "I am weary 
			- of my life 
				- because of the daughters 
					- of Heth. 
					- If Jacob takes a wife 
						- of the daughters 
							- of Heth, 
							- such as these, of the daughters 
								- of the land, 
									- what good will my life do me?"

#### Daughters of Heth were the women of the [[Zunpublished/Hittite\|Hittite]] people. Heth is a descendant of Canaan, son of Ham [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-10#v15\|Gen-10:15]]. Abraham bought a burial site from them [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-23#v3\|Gen-23:3]][[_The Scrolls/1.

#### Is Rebekah just saying this so she can justify sending Jacob away to Isaac? In the next verse he calls Jacob and sends him away.

# Connections
## Deception and Its Consequences

- Genesis 12:10–20 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-12#v10\|Gen-12#v10]]: Abram deceives Pharaoh about Sarai being his wife, leading to consequences. This parallels Jacob’s deception, showing how lying affects relationships and outcomes.
- Genesis 29:15–30 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-29#v15\|Gen-29#v15]]: Jacob is deceived by Laban, who substitutes [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Leah\|Leah]] for Rachel on Jacob’s wedding night. This mirrors Jacob’s own deception in Genesis 27, illustrating a pattern of reaping what one sows.
- Proverbs 12:22 [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-12#v22\|Prov-12#v22]]: “Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are his delight.” This underscores the moral implications of Jacob and Rebekah’s deception.
- Galatians 6:7 [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/48 - Galatians/Gal-06#v7\|Gal-06#v7]]: “Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.” This New Testament principle reflects the consequences of Jacob’s actions, as he later faces deception.

## Sibling Rivalry

- Genesis 25:21–34 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v21\|Gen-25#v21]]: The earlier account of Jacob and Esau’s birth and the selling of the birthright sets the stage for the blessing conflict in Genesis 27. Esau’s disregard for his birthright (Gen 25:29–34) contrasts with his distress in Genesis 27:34–38.
- Genesis 33:1–17 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-33#v1\|Gen-33#v1]]: Jacob and Esau’s reconciliation after years of estrangement shows the resolution of their rivalry, contrasting with the hostility in Genesis 27:41.
- 1 John 3:11–12 [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/62 - 1 John/1 John-03#v11\|1 John-03#v11]]: “We should love one another. Do not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother.” The Cain and Abel story (Gen 4:1–16) is a parallel to Jacob and Esau’s conflict, highlighting sibling enmity.

## Blessing and Inheritance

- Genesis 12:1–3 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-12#v1\|Gen-12#v1]]: God’s promise to Abraham about blessing his offspring is foundational to the patriarchal blessing in Genesis 27, as Isaac’s blessing to Jacob continues this covenant (Gen 27:27–29).
- Genesis 28:1–4 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-28#v1\|Gen-28#v1]]: Isaac reaffirms the blessing to Jacob before he flees to Haran, explicitly tying it to the Abrahamic covenant, reinforcing the significance of Genesis 27’s events.
- Hebrews 11:20 [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/58 - Hebrews/Heb-11#v20\|Heb-11#v20]]: “By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.” This New Testament reference directly cites Genesis 27, emphasizing the faith behind Isaac’s blessing despite the deception.
- Numbers 23:19–20 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-23#v19\|Num-23#v19]]: “God is not man, that he should lie… He has blessed, and I cannot revoke it.” This reflects the irrevocability of Isaac’s blessing to Jacob (Gen 27:33).

## God’s Sovereignty

- Genesis 25:23 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v23\|Gen-25#v23]]: God’s prophecy to Rebekah that “the older shall serve the younger” foreshadows the events of Genesis 27, showing that God’s plan prevails despite human schemes.
- Romans 9:10–13 [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-09#v10\|Rom-09#v10]]: Paul references Jacob and Esau, stating, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated,” to illustrate God’s sovereign choice, directly tying to Genesis 27’s outcome.
- Proverbs 19:21 [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-19#v21\|Prov-19#v21]]: “Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand.” This aligns with God’s plan unfolding through the messy events of Genesis 27.

## Family Dysfunction and Favoritism

- Genesis 37:3–4 [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-37#v3\|Gen-37#v3]]: Jacob’s favoritism toward Joseph, leading to his brothers’ jealousy, echoes the favoritism of Isaac and Rebekah toward Esau and Jacob, respectively (Gen 27:6–17).
- James 2:1 [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/59 - James/James-02#v1\|James-02#v1]]: “My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.” This principle critiques the favoritism displayed by Rebekah and Isaac in Genesis 27.
- Ephesians 6:4 [[_The Scrolls/4.
