#### City = group of dwellings surrounded by walls

#### \- God’s city’s door are never closed, they are always open, the walls designed for self preservation and protection; are basically deconstructed. As that New Jeraslem city has no walls and welcomes all, we are to do.

#### \- Isaiah 60 - light reflecting off people extention of God’s glory that brings to the nation

#### \- Matthew made a claim about Jesus being the light and the New Jersalem in the birth story - and now Jesus is claiming that He and his new disciples are to the nations. - Matthew 2

#### \- He was telling them the new Jersualem you are seeking is you - and he is about to tell you how to bring that to earth. And how to live without walls.
