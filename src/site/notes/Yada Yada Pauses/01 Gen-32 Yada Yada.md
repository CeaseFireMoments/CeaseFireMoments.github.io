- Jacob 
	- went on his way, 
	- and the angels <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Messenger\|Messenger]]<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;"> (spiritual)//  //plural//</mark>
		- of God 
		- met him. 
	- When he saw them, 
		- Jacob said, "This is God's army <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>[[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/The Camp/Camp\|Camp]]<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>." [^5]
		- He called the name of that place <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Mahanaim</mark> <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//two camps//</mark>. 
#### "AngelS of God" [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-28#v12\|Gen-28#v12]] Jacob saw "Angels of God ascending and descending

- Jacob sent [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Messenger\|Messenger]]s <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//(human)//</mark> 
	- in front of him[^2] 
		- to [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Esau\|Esau]], 
			- his brother, 
		- to the land of Seir, 
			- the field of [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/Edom\|Edom]]. 
	- He commanded them, saying, 
		- "This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: 
			- 'This is what your servant, 
				- Jacob, says. 
					- I have 
						- lived as a foreigner 
							- with Laban, 
						- and stayed until now. 
					- I have 
						- cattle, 
						- donkeys, 
						- flocks, 
						- male servants, 
						- and female servants. 
					- I have 
						- sent to tell my lord, 
							- that I may find favor in your sight.'" 
	- The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, 
		- "We came to your brother 
			- Esau. 
		- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Esau// </mark> is coming to meet you, 
			- and four hundred men are with him." 
			- Then Jacob was 
				- greatly afraid 
				- and was distressed. 
				- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob// </mark> divided the people 
					- who were with him, 
					- along with 
						- the flocks, 
						- the herds, 
						- and the camels, 
					- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">into two companies</mark>. <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//camp//</mark>
#### Jacob named the place Mahanaim (“two camps”) because of God’s camp + his own.  Then in v7, he creates two camps (machanot) out of fear of Esau — echoing the name Mahanaim. Machăneh = singular "camp. Machănayim = dual "two camps." Machănôt = plural "camps/companies.

- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob// </mark> said, 
	- "If Esau comes to the one company, 
		- and strikes it, 
	- then the company which is left 
		- will escape." 
- Jacob said, 
	- "God 
		- of my father Abraham, 
		- and God of my father Isaac, 
			- Yahweh, 
			- who said to me <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob// </mark>, 
				- 'Return to your country, 
				- and to your relatives, 
				- and I will do you good,' [^6]
	- I am not worthy 
		- of the least of all the loving kindnesses, 
		- and of all the truth, 
			- which you have shown to your servant; 
		- for with just my staff 
			- I crossed over this Jordan; 
		- and now I have <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">become two companies</mark>. <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Machănôt camps//</mark>
	- Please deliver me 
		- from the hand of my brother, 
			- from the hand of Esau; 
		- for I fear him, 
			- lest he come and strike me 
			- and the mothers with the children. 
	- You <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//YHWH// </mark>  said[^3], 
		- 'I will surely do you good[^4], 
		- and make your offspring 
			- as the sand of the sea[^7], 
				- which can't be counted 
					- because there are so many.'" 
- He stayed <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">there</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">that night</mark>, 
	- and took from that 
		- which he had with him 
			- a present for Esau, 
				- his brother: 
				- two hundred female goats 
				- and twenty male goats, 
				- two hundred ewes 
				- and twenty rams, 
				- thirty milk camels 
					- and their colts, 
				- forty cows, 
				- ten bulls, 
				- twenty female donkeys 
					- and ten foals. 
	- He delivered them <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//the animals//</mark>
		- into the hands 
			- of his servants, 
		- every herd by itself, 
		- and said to his servants,
			- "Pass over <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//ʿābar//</mark> before me, 
			- and put a space between herd and herd." 
			- He commanded the foremost, saying, 
				- "When Esau, 
					- my brother, 
					- meets you, 
					- and asks you, saying, 
						- 'Whose are you? 
						- Where are you going? 
						- Whose are these before you?' 
					- Then you shall say, 
						- 'They are your servant, 
							- Jacob's. 
						- It is a present sent to my lord, 
							- Esau. 
						- Behold, he also is behind us.'" 
			- He commanded also 
				- the second, 
				- and the third, 
				- and all that followed the herds, saying,
					- "This is how you shall speak to Esau, 
						- when you find him. 
						- You shall say, 
							- 'Not only that, 
							- but behold, your servant, 
								- Jacob,
							- is behind us.'" 
			- For, he said, "I will appease him <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Esau//</mark> 
				- with the present 
					- that goes before me, 
				- and afterward 
					- I will see his face. 
				- [^1]Perhaps he will accept me." 
			- So the present passed over 
				- before him, 
				- and he himself <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">stayed</mark> 
					- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">that night</mark> 
						- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">in the camp</mark>. 
#### Pass over -ʿābar,  means to pass/cross over a boundary, in this case the stream.
#### The 5 herds with spaces between them would stretch approximately ¾ mile (or about 4,000 feet)

 - He rose up 
	 - <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">that night</mark>, 
	 - and took his 
		 - two wives, 
		 - and his two servants, 
		 - and his eleven sons, 
	 - and crossed over the ford 
		 - of the Jabbok. 
	 - He took them, 
		 - and sent them 
			 - over the stream, 
		 - and sent over 
			 - that which he had. 
	 - Jacob was left alone, 
		 - and wrestled <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">with a man</mark> there 
			 - <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">until the breaking of the day</mark>.
		 - When he <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//the man// </mark>saw 
			 - that <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">he didn't prevail</mark> 
				 - against him <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob//</mark>, 
			 - the man 
				 - touched the hollow of his <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob//</mark>thigh, 
					 - and the hollow of Jacob's thigh 
						 - was strained as he wrestled. 
#### In Hebrew mindset, the thigh = seat of strength and offspring. Oaths are sworn by placing hand under the thigh ([[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-24#v2\|Gen-24#v2]]) - tied to life, seed, and covenant continuity. 

- The man said, 
	- "Let me go, 
		- for the day breaks." 
- Jacob said, 
	- "I won't let you go 
		- unless you bless me." 
- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//the man//</mark> said to him <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob//</mark>, 
	- "What is your name?" 
- He said, 
	- "Jacob". 
- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//the man//</mark> said, 
	- "Your name will no longer be called Jacob, 
		- but [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]; 
			- for you have fought 
				- with <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">God</mark> 
				- and with men, 
			- and have prevailed." 
	- Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." 
		- He said, 
			- "Why is it that you ask what my name is?" 
		- So he blessed him there. 
- Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; 
	- for he said, 
		- "I have seen God face to face[^8], 
		- and my life is preserved." 
- The sun rose on him 
	- as he passed over [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/Peniel\|Peniel]], <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//face of god//</mark>
	- and he limped because of his thigh. 
		- Therefore the children of Israel 
			- don't eat the sinew of the hip, 
				- which is on the hollow of the thigh, 
			- to this day, 
				- because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh 
					- in the sinew of the hip.
#### The chapter starts with Jacob and the Angels of YHWH - two camps and ends with Jacob and the Man face to face. 
- Hosea 12: 4 In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel, and in his vigor he strove with God (Elohim). 5 Yes, he wrestled with the angel (malʾāk) and won; he wept and sought his favor.
#### Man, in Hebrew, the generic word for “man/male/human.” (אִישׁ) deliberate ambiguity—the reader is meant to wonder what kind of “man” can wrestle all night and dislocate a hip with a touch. The same word אִישׁ is used of Jacob himself earlier (e.g., 32:6), so the text sets up a mirror-like confrontation (Jacob vs. “a man” who is his equal/opposite). 
#### V 24 English “wrestled” is functional but erases the dusty, ground-scraping chaos implied. The verb paints a dirty, primal struggle, not a clean athletic bout. Jacob is literally “dusted” (humiliated, reduced to the earth) before his exaltation as Israel.
#### The phrase is technical—the sciatic nerve/muscle insertion at the hip.  English “thigh” or “hip” is vague; Hebrew preserves exact anatomical correspondence between injury and taboo, grounding the etiology in the same body part.

#### The new name Israel is a pun on the verb śārîtā (“you have striven”). English can only footnote it.  אֱלֹהִים and אֲנָשִׁים are phonologically parallel (both end in -īm); the text equates Jacob’s human struggles (Esau, Laban) with his divine encounter. English loses the sound-echo.

#### Lost layers:  פְּנִיאֵל (pənîʾēl) = “face of God.” The name is iconic—Jacob sees God’s face yet lives (contra Exod 33:20). English “Peniel” is just a proper noun.  פָּנִים אֶל־פָּנִים is idiomatic for the most intimate encounter; literally “face to face.” The wrestling is eye-to-eye combat. Jacob refuses to give his name to the opponent but receives a new one—a reversal of human-divine naming conventions (cf. Gen 2:19–20). English misses the power dynamic. It is lethal proximity—Jacob gazes into the divine face (פְּנִיאֵל) and emerges alive (וַתִּנָּצֵל נַפְשִׁי), turning a death-sentence into a birth-certificate for Israel.

#### Until the ascent of the dawn (שַׁחַר) - both “dawn” and the name of a Canaanite dawn-deity. The opponent must leave at first light—a mythic motif flattened in English.  
#### Jacob limps at sunrise (v. 31): the new name Israel is born on the threshold between night (fear, deceit) and day (reconciliation with Esau).
