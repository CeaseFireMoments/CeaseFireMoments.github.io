- <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Jacob</mark> heard 
	- Laban's sons' words, saying, 
		- "Jacob has taken away 
			- all that was our father's. 
		- He has obtained 
			- all this wealth 
				- from that which was our father's." 
- Jacob saw the expression 
	- on Laban's face, 
		- and, behold, it [^10]was not toward him as before. 

#### Sounds like a replay of what happened with [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Isaac\|Isaac]] (Isaac's son ... father's face toward him ... )

- Yahweh said 
	- to Jacob, 
		- "Return 
			- <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">to the land</mark> 
				- of your fathers, 
			- and <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">to your relatives</mark>, 
		- and I will be with you." [[Gate of Wisdom/Covenant/Jacobiac\|Jacobiac]]
	- Jacob 
		- sent and called 
			- Rachel and Leah 
				- to the field to his flock, 
		- and said to them, 
			- "I see the expression 
				- on your father's face, 
					- that it is not toward me as before; 
			- but the God 
				- of my father 
					- has been with me. 
			- You know that 
				- I have served 
					- your father 
					- with all of my strength. 
				- Your father <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Laban//</mark> 
					- has deceived me[^1], [^12]
					- and changed my wages ten times, 
				- but God 
					- didn't allow him 
						- to hurt me. 
					- If he said, 
						- 'The speckled will be your wages,' 
							- then all the flock bore speckled. 
						- If he said, 'The streaked will be your wages,' 
							- then all the flock bore streaked. 
					- Thus <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">God</mark> 
						- has <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">taken away</mark> 
							- your father's livestock, 
						- and [^4]given them to me. 
					- During mating season, 
						- I lifted up my eyes, 
						- and saw in a dream, 
						- and behold, the male goats 
							- which leaped on the flock 
							- were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. 
						- The <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">angel of God</mark> said //elohim malakh [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Messenger\|Messenger]]//
							- to me 
								- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">in the dream</mark>, 
									- 'Jacob,' 
										- and I said, 'Here I am.' 
									- He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, 
									- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for I have seen all that Laban does to you. </mark>
									- <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">I am the God of Bethel</mark>, 
										- <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">where you anointed a pillar</mark>, 
										- where [^6]you vowed a vow to me. 
									- Now arise, 
										- <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">get out from this land</mark>, 
										- and <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">return to the land</mark> 
											- of your birth.'" 

		- Rachel and Leah answered him, 
			- "Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
			- Aren't we considered as foreigners by him? 
				- For he has sold us, 
				- and has also used up our money.
				- For all the riches which God has taken away from our father 
					- are ours and our children's. 
				- Now then, whatever God has said to you, do." 
		- Then Jacob 
			- rose up, 
			- and set his sons and his wives on the camels, 
			- and he took away all his livestock, 
			- and all his possessions which he had gathered, 
				- including the livestock which he had gained 
					- in Paddan Aram, 
			- to go to Isaac 
				- his father, 
				- to the land of Canaan. 
#### Cultural norms at that time: Daughters could inherit only if adopted as “sons” or via dowry. Otherwise, they were “sold” into marriage. Daughters typically received movable dowry (jewelry, slaves, livestock) from father, but Laban kept Jacob’s wages as de facto bride-price compensation. 
#### Old Babylonian contracts: If father gave no dowry, daughters could claim a share at his death—but rare in practice.

- Now Laban had gone 
	- to shear his sheep; 
	- and [^2]Rachel 
		- stole the teraphim 
			- that were her father's. 

#### Possession of household gods (ilu/teraphim) could legitimize a secondary heir’s claim to estate if the primary heir was absent or disputed.

- <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Jacob</mark> [^3]<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">deceived</mark> 
	- Laban 
		- the Syrian, 
		- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">in that he didn't tell him</mark> 
			- that he was running away. 
		- So he fled 
			- with all that he had. 
		- He rose up, passed over the River, 
		- and set his face 
			- toward the <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">mountain of Gilead</mark>. 

#### Husband could relocate wife/children without consent if bride-price paid. 
#### deceived - tricked - literal meaning: “stole the heart/mind of Laban” Idiomatic Hebrew for deceiving someone by concealing intentions. Laban never directly accuses Jacob of deception — only of leaving secretly (Gen 31:27).

- <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Laban</mark> was told 
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the third day</mark> [^13]
		- that Jacob had fled. 
	- He //Laban// 
		- took his relatives with him, 
		- and pursued him 
			- seven days' journey. [^14]
			- He overtook him in the [^7]<mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">mountain of Gilead</mark>. [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/Gilead\|Gilead]]
- God came to 
	- Laban 
		- the Syrian 
		- <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">in a dream</mark> 
			- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">of the night</mark>, 
		- and said to him, 
			- "Be careful 
				- that you don't speak 
					- to Jacob 
						- either good or bad." 
- Laban caught up 
	- with Jacob. 
	- Now Jacob had
		- [^8]pitched his tent 
			- in the mountain, 
	- and Laban 
		- with his relatives 
		- encamped in the mountain 
			- of Gilead. 
	- Laban said 
		- to Jacob, 
			- "<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">What have you done</mark>, 
				- that you have deceived me, 
					- and carried away 
						- my daughters 
							- like captives of the sword? 
			- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Why did you flee secretly</mark>, 
				- and deceive me, 
				- and didn't tell me, 
					- that I might have 
						- sent you away 
							- with mirth 
							- and with songs, 
							- with tambourine 
							- and with harp; 
				- and didn't allow me 
					- to kiss 
						- my sons 
						- and my daughters? 
				- Now have you done foolishly. 
			- It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, 
				- but the <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">God</mark> 
					- of your father 
				- spoke to me last night, saying, 
					- 'Be careful that you don't 
						- speak to Jacob 
							- either good or bad.' 
			- Now, you want to be gone, 
				- because you greatly longed for your father's house, 
					- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">but why have you stolen my gods?"</mark> 
#### Pitched his tent by a mountain - image of Moses coming down after the calf incident and pitching his tent outside the camp comes to mind.
- 
	- Jacob answered 
		- Laban, 
			- "<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Because I was afraid</mark>, for I said, 
				- 'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.' 
			- Anyone you find your gods with 
				- shall not live. 
				- Before our relatives, 
					- discern what is yours with me, 
					- and take it." 
				- For Jacob didn't know 
					- that Rachel 
						- had stolen them. 
		- Laban went 
			- into Jacob's tent, 
			- into Leah's tent, 
			- and into the tent of the two female servants; 
				- but he didn't find them. 
			- He went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 
				- Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, 
					- put them in the camel's saddle, 
						- and sat on them. 
			- Laban felt around all the tent, 
				- but didn't find them. 
			- She <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Rachel// </mark>said 
				- to her father, 
					- "Don't let my lord be angry 
						- that I can't rise up before you; 
						- for[^11] I'm having my period." 
							- He searched, but didn't find the teraphim. 
	- Jacob was angry, and argued 
		- with Laban. 
		- Jacob answered Laban, 
			- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"What is my trespass?</mark> 
				- What is my sin, 
					- that you have hotly pursued me? 
			- Now that you have felt around 
				- in all my stuff, 
				- what have you found of all your household stuff? 
					- Set it here 
						- before my relatives 
						- and your relatives, 
							- that they may judge between us two. 
			- "These <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">twenty years </mark>[^15]
				- I have been with you. 
					- Your ewes 
					- and your female goats 
						- have not cast their young, 
					- and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks. 
					- That which was torn of animals, 
						- I didn't bring to you. 
							- I bore its loss. 
							- Of my hand you required it, 
								- whether stolen by day 
								- or stolen by night. 
							- This was my situation: 
								- in the day the drought consumed me, 
								- and the frost by night; 
								- and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
			- These twenty years 
				- I have been in your house. 
					- I served you 
						- fourteen years 
							- for your two daughters, 
						- and six years 
							- for your flock, 
					- and you have changed 
						- my wages ten times. 
			- Unless the God 
				- of my father, 
				- the God of Abraham, 
				- and the fear of Isaac, 
					- had been with me, 
						- surely now you would have sent me away empty. 
				- God has seen 
					- my [^5]affliction 
					- and the labor 
						- of my hands, 
					- and rebuked you last night." 
	- Laban answered 
		- Jacob, 
			- "The daughters 
				- are my daughters, 
			- the children 
				- are my children, 
			- the flocks 
				- are my flocks, 
			- and all that you see 
				- is mine! 
			- What can I do today 
				- to these my daughters, 
				- or to their children 
					- whom they have borne? 
		- Now come, 
			- let's make a covenant, 
				- you and I. 
			- Let it be for a witness 
				- between me and you." 
			- Jacob took a stone, 
			- and set it up for a pillar. 
	- Jacob said 
		- to his relatives, 
			- "Gather stones." 
			- They took stones, 
				- and made a heap. 
			- They ate there by the heap. 
	- Laban called it 
		- Jegar Sahadutha, <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Heap of Witness in Aramaic//</mark>
			- but Jacob called it 
				- Galeed. <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Heap of Witness in Hebrew//</mark>
	- Laban said, 
		- "This heap is witness 
			- between me and you <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">today</mark>." 
				- Therefore it was named 
					- Galeed 
					- and Mizpah, <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Watchpost, lookout place, God’s watchful eye in Hebrew//</mark>
						- for he said, "Yahweh watch 
							- between me and you, 
						- when we are absent 
							- one from another. 
						- If you 
							- afflict my daughters, 
							- or if you take wives 
								- in addition to my daughters, 
						- no man is with us <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//even if no man sees//</mark>; 
							- behold, God is witness 
								- between me and you." 
		- Laban said 
			- to Jacob, 
				- "See this heap, 
				- and see the pillar, 
					- which I have set 
						- between me and you. 
				- May this heap be a witness, 
				- and the pillar be a witness, 
					- that I will not pass over this heap 
						- to you, 
					- and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar 
						- to me, 
					- for harm. 
				- The God 
					- of Abraham, 
					- and the God of Nahor <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Abrahams father//</mark>, 
					- the God of their father, 
					- judge between us." 
		- Then Jacob 
			- swore by the fear of his father, 
				- Isaac. 
		- Jacob offered a sacrifice 
			- in the mountain, 
			- and called his relatives 
				- to eat bread. 
			- They ate bread, 
				- and stayed all night 
					- in the mountain. 
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Early in the morning</mark>, 
		- Laban 
			- rose up, 
			- and kissed his sons 
			- and his daughters, 
			- and blessed them. 
			- Laban departed and returned to his place.
