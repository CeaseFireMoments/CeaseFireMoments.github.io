###### v1 
- God said 
	- to Jacob, 
		- "Arise, go up to [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/Bethel\|Bethel]], 
			- and live there. 
			- Make there an altar[^10] 
				- to God[^5], 
					- who appeared to you 
						- when you fled 
							- from the face 
								- of Esau 
									- your brother." 
- Then Jacob 
	- said to his household, 
		- and to all who were with him, 
		- "Put away the foreign gods[^4] 
			- that are among you, 
		- purify yourselves, 
		- change your garments.
		- Let's arise, and go up to Bethel. 
		- I will make there an altar 
			- to God, 
				- who answered me in the day of my distress, 
				- and was with me on the way which I went."
	- They gave to Jacob 
		- all the foreign gods 
			- which were in their hands, 
		- and the rings 
			- which were in their ears; 
		- and Jacob hid them 
			- under the oak 
				- which was by Shechem.
- They traveled, 
	- and a terror 
		- of God 
		- was on the cities 
			- that were around them, 
		- and they didn't pursue 
			- the sons of Jacob. 
- So Jacob came 
	- to Luz 
		- (that is, Bethel), 
		- which is in the land of Canaan, 
	- he and all the people 
		- who were with him.
	- He built an altar there, 
		- and called the place El Beth El; 
			- because there God was revealed to him, 
				- when he fled 
					- from the face of his brother.
	- Deborah, 
		- Rebekah's nurse, 
		- died, 
		- and she was buried 
			- below Bethel 
				- under the oak; 
			- and its name was called Allon [^3]Bacuth. 
- God appeared 
	- to Jacob 
		- again when he came from Paddan Aram, 
		- and blessed him.
- God said 
	- to him, 
		- "Your name is Jacob. 
		- Your name shall not be Jacob any more, 
			- but your name 
				- will be Israel." [[Gen 32#v28\|Gen 32#v28]]
		- He named him Israel. 
- God said 
	- to him, 
		- "I am God Almighty. 
		- Be fruitful and multiply. 
		- A nation and a company of nations 
			- will be from you, 
		- and kings will come out 
			- of your body[^6].
		- The land which I gave 
			- to Abraham and Isaac, 
			- I will give it 
				- to you, 
				- and to your offspring after you 
			- I will give the land.[^7]" 
- God went up 
	- from him 
		- in the place 
			- where he spoke 
				- with him.
- Jacob set up a pillar 
	- in the place 
	- where he spoke with him, 
		- a pillar of stone. <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//altar//</mark>
			- He poured out a [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Drink Offering\|Drink Offering]] on it, [^9]
			- and poured oil on it. 
	- Jacob called the name of the place 
		- where God spoke with him 
		- "Bethel". 
- They traveled from Bethel. 
	- There was still some distance 
		- to come to Ephrath, 
	- and Rachel travailed. 
		- She had hard labor.
			- When she was in hard labor, 
				- the midwife said to her, 
					- "Don't be afraid, 
						- for now you will have another son."
				- As her soul was departing (
					- for she died), 
					- she named him [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Benoni\|Benoni]][^2], 
						- but his father named him [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Benjamin\|Benjamin]].
				- Rachel died, and was buried 
					- on the way to Ephrath 
						- (also called Bethlehem).
					- Jacob set up a pillar 
						- on her grave.
						- The same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave 
							- to this day.
	- Israel traveled, 
		- and spread his tent 
			- beyond the tower of Eder.
	- While Israel lived in that land, 
		- Reuben went 
			- and lay with Bilhah[^8], 
				- his father's concubine, 
			- and Israel heard of it[^1]. 
		- Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
			- The sons of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Leah\|Leah]]: 
				- Reuben 
					- (Jacob's firstborn), 
				- Simeon, 
				- Levi, 
				- Judah, 
				- Issachar, 
				- and Zebulun.
			- The sons of Rachel: 
				- Joseph 
				- and Benjamin. 
			- The sons of Bilhah 
				- (Rachel's servant): 
				- Dan 
				- and Naphtali.
			- The sons of Zilpah 
				- (Leah's servant): 
				- Gad 
				- and Asher. 
			- These are the sons of Jacob, 
				- who were born to him 
					- in Paddan Aram.
	- Jacob came 
		- to Isaac 
			- his father, 
			- to Mamre, 
				- to Kiriath Arba 
					- (which is Hebron), 
			- where Abraham and Isaac lived 
				- as foreigners.
		- The days of Isaac 
			- were one hundred eighty years.
		- Isaac 
			- gave up the spirit and died, 
			- and was gathered to his people, 
				- old and full of days. 
		- Esau and Jacob, 
			- his sons, 
			- buried him.
