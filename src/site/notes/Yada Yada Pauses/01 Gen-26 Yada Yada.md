# Outline
# Isaac

- There was a famine 
	- in the land, 
	- in addition to the first famine 
		- that was in the days 
			- of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]].  [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-12#v10\|Gen-12:10]]
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Isaac\|Isaac]] went to 
		- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abimelech\|Abimelech]] 
			- king of the [[Zunpublished/Philistines\|Philistines]], to Gerar. 
		- Yahweh appeared 
			- to him <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Isaac//</mark>, and said, 
				- "Don't go down into Egypt. 
				- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Live in the land</mark> 
					- I will tell you about. 
				- Live in this land, 
					- and I will be with you, 
					- and will bless you. 
					- For I will give 
						- to you, 
						- and to your offspring, 
							- all these lands, 
					- and I will establish the oath 
						- which I swore to [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]] your father. //[[Gate of Wisdom/Covenant/Abrahamic\|Abrahamic]] Covenant//
							- I will multiply your offspring 
								- as the stars of the sky, 
								- and will give all these lands 
									- to your offspring. 
									- In your offspring 
										- all the nations of the earth 
											- will be blessed, //[[Gate of Wisdom/Covenant/Isaacic\|Isaacic]] Covenant//
						- because Abraham 
							- obeyed my voice, 
							- and kept my requirements, 
							- my commandments, 
							- my statutes, 
							- and my laws."
					- Isaac lived in Gerar. 

#### BECAUSE Abraham obeyed - Yah/God makes the covenant with Isaac IF Isaac stays in the land of Gerar and does not go down to Egypt [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-12\|Gen-12]]; [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-17\|Gen-17]]; [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-18\|Gen-18]]; [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-22\|Gen-22]]

# Abimelech

- The men of the place //Gerar// 
	- asked him 
		- about his wife. 
			- He said, "She is my sister," 
				- for he was afraid to say, 
					- "My wife", 
					- lest, he thought, "the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah,
						 - because she is beautiful to look at." 
			 - When he had been there a long time, 
				 - [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abimelech\|Abimelech]] 
					 - king of the Philistines 
					 - looked out at a window, 
					 - and saw, 
					 - and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, 
						 - his wife. 
					 - Abimelech called Isaac, and said, 
						 - "Behold, surely she is your wife. 
						 - Why did you say, 'She is my sister?'" 
						 - Isaac said to him, 
							 - "Because I said, 'Lest I die because of her.'" 
					 - Abimelech said, 
						 - "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!" 
						 - Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, 
							 - "He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death." 

#  [[Gate of Wisdom/Covenant/Isaacic\|Isaacic]] Covenant

- Isaac 
	- sowed in that land, 
	- and reaped in the same year 
		- one hundred times what he planted. 
			- Yahweh blessed him. 
	- The man 
		- grew great, 
		- and grew more and more 
			- until he became very great. 
			- He had 
				- possessions of flocks, 
				- possessions of herds, 
				- and a great household. 
		- The Philistines envied him. 
			- Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug 
				- in the days of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]] 
					- his father, 
				- the Philistines 
					- had stopped, 
					- and filled with earth. 
			- Abimelech said to Isaac, 
				- "Go away from us, 
					- for you are much mightier than we." 
				- Isaac departed from there, 
					- encamped in the valley of Gerar, 
					- and lived there. 
					- Isaac dug again the wells of water, 
						- which they had dug 
							- in the days of Abraham his father, 
								- for the Philistines 
									- had stopped them 
										- after the death of Abraham. 
						- He called their names 
							- after the names by which his father had called them.
						- Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing water. 
							- The herdsmen of Gerar 
								- argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, 
									- "The water is ours." 
								- So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. 
						- They dug another well, 
							- and they argued over that, also. 
							- So he called its name Sitnah. 
					- He left that place, 
						- and dug another well. 
							- They didn't argue over that one. 
							- So he called it Rehoboth. 
								- He said, "For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land." 
	- He went up from there to Beersheba. 
		- Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, 
			- "I am the God of Abraham 
				- your father. 
				- Don't be afraid, 
					- for I am with you, 
					- and will bless you, 
					- and multiply your offspring 
						- for my servant Abraham's sake." 
		- He built an altar there, 
			- and called on Yahweh's name, 
			- and pitched his tent there. 
		- There Isaac's servants dug a well. 

# Abimelech Covenant with Isaac

- Then Abimelech went 
	- to him //Isaac// 
		- from Gerar 
		- with Ahuzzath 
			- his friend, 
		- and Phicol 
			- the captain of his army. 
	- Isaac said to them, 
		- "Why have you come to me, 
			- since you hate me, 
			- and have sent me away from you?" 
	- They said, 
		- "We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. 
		- We said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, 
			- even between us and you, 
			- and let's make a covenant with you, 
				- that you will do us no harm, 
					- as we have not touched you, 
					- and as we have done to you nothing but good, 
					- and have sent you away in peace.' 
						- You are now the blessed of Yahweh." 
	- He made them a feast, 
		- and they ate 
		- and drank. 
	- They rose up some time in the morning, 
		- and swore an oath to one another. 
		- Isaac sent them away, 
			- and they departed from him 
				- in peace. 
	- The same day, Isaac's servants came, and told him 
		- concerning the well which they had dug, 
			- and said to him, "We have found water." 
		- He called it "Shibah". 
			- Therefore the name of the city is "Beersheba" to this day. 
			- 
# Esau

- When Esau was forty years old, 
	- he took as wife Judith, 
		- the daughter of Beeri 
			- the Hittite, 
	- and Basemath, 
		- the daughter of Elon 
			- the Hittite. 
	- They <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Judith and Basemath//</mark> grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits.
