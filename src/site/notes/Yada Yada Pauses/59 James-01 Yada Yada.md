## What:
- **Main Storyline:** - Greeting to the dispersed; count trials as joy for producing steadfastness; ask God for wisdom in faith; the poor are exalted and the rich humbled; blessed is the one who endures temptation; God tempts no one but desire leads to sin and death; every good gift is from the unchanging Father; be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; put away filthiness and receive the implanted word that saves; be doers of the word, not hearers only; pure religion is to visit orphans and widows and remain unstained.

	- in that he is made humble, 
	- because like the flower in the grass,

#### Matthew 6:13 lead us not into peirasmos
- Let no man say when he is tempted, 
	- "I am tempted by God,"

		- my beloved brothers. 
#### The deception, lust, enticement comes from within.
#### Planasthe = to wander, stray, go astray; to lead astray, deceive

- Every 
	- good gift 
	- and every perfect gift [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-23#v19\|Num-23#v19]]
		- is from above, 
		- coming down from the Father of lights[^7], 
			- with whom can be 
				- no variation, 
				- nor turning shadow. 
			- Of his own will 
				- he gave birth to us 
					- by the word of truth, 
						- <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">that we should be a kind of first fruits</mark> [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-02#v3\|Jer-02#v3]]
							- of his creatures. 
#### [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-119#v160\|Ps-119#v160]] The sum of thy word is truth (’ĕmet)”) ; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/43 - John/John-17#v17\|John-17#v17]] “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth” ; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-01#v13\|Ephes-01#v13]] “…the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation”; [[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/60 - 1 Peter/1 Pet-01#v23\|1 Pet-01#v23]] “…born again… by the word of God”

- So, then <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//because God has given us every perfect gift, brought us new life, and we are a kind of first fruits//</mark>, 
	- my beloved brothers, 
	- let every man be 
		- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">swift to hear</mark>, 
		- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">slow to speak</mark>, [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-10#v19\|Prov-10#v19]]
		- and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">slow to anger</mark>; 
			- for the <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">anger</mark> of man [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-14#v29\|Prov-14#v29]]
				- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">doesn't produce </mark>the [[Gate of Wisdom/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] of God[^1]. 
			- Therefore <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//because anger fails to produce righteousness//</mark>, 
				- putting away 
					- all filthiness 
					- and overflowing of wickedness, 
				- receive with humility 
					- the implanted word, [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-30#v14\|Deut-30#v14]]
						- which is able to [[Gate of Wisdom/Save\|Save]] your souls. 
					- But <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">be doers of the word</mark>, 
						- and not only hearers, 
							- deluding your own selves. 
						- For if anyone is a hearer of the word 
							- and not a doer, [[_The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/26 - Ezekiel/Ezek-33#v32\|Ezek-33#v32]]
							- he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror; [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-27#v19\|Prov-27#v19]]
								- for he sees himself, 
								- and goes away, 
								- and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 
							- But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom 
								- and continues, 
									- not being a hearer who forgets, 
								- but a doer of the work, 
									- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">this man will be blessed in what he does</mark>. [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-19#v7\|Ps-19#v7]]
#### Filthiness = moral defilement; the outward overflow of inner sin (anger, malice, etc., from vv. 19–20) that must be stripped off like dirty clothes before the word can be humbly received. Used only here in the entire New Testament. Zech. 3:3–4: Joshua the high priest stands in "filthy garments" (rhypara) symbolizing sin/iniquity.

- If anyone among you thinks 
	- himself to be religious 
		- while he doesn't bridle his [[Zunpublished/tongue\|tongue]], [[_The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-34#v13\|Ps-34#v13]]
			- but deceives his heart, 
	- this man's religion is worthless. 
	- Pure religion and undefiled 
		- before our God and Father is this: 
			- to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, 
			- and to keep oneself unstained by the world. [[_The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-14#v29\|Deut-14#v29]]
