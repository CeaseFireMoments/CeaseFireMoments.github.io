[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-05\|Matt-05]]

Pure, clean, unstained. Most instances refer to spiritual cleanliness.

At heart … Does this mean we should be eating healthy so our heart can be pure, and clean? No, when we see heart in Jewish literature it typically refers to a person’s mind and thoughts.

Psalm 199 says, “Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord!”

Many do not believe we can be pure, unstained, blameless. We are all sinners, we can not live without sin, right?

Then why would Jesus say those who are clean and pure in their mind and thoughts/heart see YHWH/God?

Didn’t we just talk about the mercy Jesus has offered? If you didn’t see that one, it’s the post just before this one.

Jesus is a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to YHWH/God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.

Didn’t we talk about those who hunger and thirst to be in right relationship with YHWH/God and other’s being filled/satisfied?

This isn’t about physically seeing YHWH. It isn’t about “going to heaven” and seeing YHWH/God. This is about what do you see in others?

If you walk through life with your mind and thoughts clean, pure, and unstained, no matter where you look or who/what you look at, you will see YHWH/God. He is the creator of everything. He’s in each and every human being. He’s in each and every animal. He’s everywhere you see nature.

If you don’t see YHWH/God all around you, maybe it’s because your mind and thought isn’t so pure?

Flash back the Jewish disciples would have seen: [Psalm 1, Psalm 24:3-4; Proverbs 22:11; Psalms 73:1; 1 Chronicles 29:17; Psalms 51:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+1%2C+Psalm+24%3A3-4%3B+Proverbs+22%3A11%3B+Psalms+73%3A1%3B+1+Chronicles+29%3A17%3B+Psalms+51%3A6&version=TLV;OJB)
