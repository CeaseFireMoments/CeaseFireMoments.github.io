## Genesis – Matthew – Revelation Connections

Read [[Sacred Truces/Matthew 5 Sermon on the Mount v 14-16 Light of the World\|Matthew 5 Sermon on the Mount v 14-16 Light of the World]] and

[[Sacred Truces/Matthew 5 Sermon on the Mount v 17-20 Jesus – the Law and the Prophets\|Matthew 5 Sermon on the Mount v 17-20 Jesus – the Law and the Prophets]] first

There seems to be a connection between Genesis 1 and 2 and Revelation 21 and 22 to Matthew 5:13-20 passages. It is fascinating and worth peeking at and appreciating before we move on …

> In the beginning God created the hashomayim/ **heavens** and the haaretz / **earth**. Now the **earth** was chaos and waste, **darkness** was on the surface of the deep, and the *Ruach Elohim*  was hovering upon the surface of the water. Then God said, “Let there be **light**!” and there was **light**. God saw that the **light** was tov /good. So God distinguished the ohr/ **light** from the choshech/ **darkness**.
> 
> Then Adonai Elohim formed the man out of the dust from the ground and He breathed into his nostrils a breath of life—so the man became a living being. Then Adonai Elohim planted a **garden in Eden** in the east, and there He put the man whom He had formed. Then Adonai Elohim caused to sprout from the ground every tree that was desirable to look at and good for food.
> 
> Now the **Tree of Life** was in the middle of the garden, and also the **Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil**. A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden. From there it divided and became four riverheads.
> 
> Then I saw a Shomayim Chadashim/ **new heaven** and a Eretz Chadasha/ **new earth**; for the shomayim harishonah/ **first heaven** and the haaretz harishonah/ **first earth** had **passed away**, and the sea was no more. I also saw the **holy city** —the **New Jerusalem** —coming down out of Shomayim / **heaven** from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. I also heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “Behold, the **dwelling** of God is among men, and He shall **tabernacle** among them. They shall be His people, and God Himself shall be **among** them and be their God.
> 
> I saw **no temple** in her, for its **Temple** is Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot and the Lamb. And **the city** has no need for **the shemesh** / **sun** **or the levanah** / **moon to shine** on it, for the **glory of God lights it up**, and **its menorah** / **lamp is the Lamb**. The **nations** shall **walk by its Ohr** / **light**, and the **kings of the ha’aretz** / **earth** bring their glory into it. Its gates shall never be shut by day, for there shall be **no night there**! And they shall bring into it the glory and honor of the **nations**.
> 
> Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life— **bright** as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the **city’s street**. On either side of the river was a Etz HaChayyim/ **tree of life**, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the **healing of the nations**. No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in the city, and His servants shall serve Him. They shall see His face, and His **name shall be on their foreheads**. **Night shall be no more**, and people will have **no need for ohr** / **light menorah** / **lamplight or shemesh** / **sunlight** —for **Adonai Elohim will ohr** / **shine** on them. And they **shall reign forever and ever**!

The New Heaven and New Earth are a picture of Eden. Revelation comes full circle back to Genesis.

Do you remember a few blogs back when we learned what the word New actually meant? This word in Hebrew is slightly different than what we think of when we think new. It typically means, ‘to restore to a previous condition.’ Another word we might use today is refurbished. Revelation is a picture of a New Eden, where Heaven and Earth co-existed. It is being restored to it’s previous glorious condition.

Back in Genesis, Man and Woman were supposed to rule over the earth. Here is Revelation, we see Man and Woman are reigning with God forever in New Jerusalem!

> And *Yeshua* said to them, “Amen, I tell you, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne in the new world, you who have followed Me shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, for My name’s sake, will receive a hundred times as much, and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”
