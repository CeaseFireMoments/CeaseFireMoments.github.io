To [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Jew\|Jew]]s, this is the most holiest of days. But many Christians have barely heard of the [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Day of Atonement\|Day of Atonement]], unless in relation to Jesus’s second coming, yet it has many connections to Jesus The Anointed One/Christ and exactly what he has done and will do.

Do you remember when they cast lots over Jesus’s garments? There are only two others who had lots cast for them, the scapegoat and Jonah.

## The Past

On the Day of Atonement, the [[Zunpublished/High Priest\|High Priest]], who was anointed and consecrated to be the High Priest in his father’s place, put on the holy linen garments, and made the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ransom\|Ransom]]([[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Disobedience/Atonement\|Atonement]]). He made ransom/atonement for the [[Zunpublished/Most Set Apart Place\|Most Set Apart Place]]/Holy of Holies, the Tent of Meeting/[[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Tabernacle\|Tabernacle]], the priests, and all the people of the assembly ([[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]). The High Priests served at a sanctuary that was a copy and shadow of what is in heaven.

He would bring a [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Sin Offering\|Sin Offering]] and a ram offering. The Sin offering was to make ransom/atonement for the High Priest and his house. Then two goats would be presented at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting/Tabernacle. The High Priest would cast lots for the two goats – one for YHWH/God and the other for the scapegoat. The goat which the lot for YHWH/God fell on would be made as a sin offering. The goat which the lot fell as the scapegoat would be presented before YHWH/God to make atonement upon it by sending it away as the scapegoat into the wilderness.

The sin offering goat would be for the people, it’s blood would be brought before and sprinkled upon the atonement cover ([[Zunpublished/Seat of Atonement\|Seat of Atonement]])/mercy seat. It was because of the uncleanness of Israel and their transgressions, all their sins.

The High Priest would lay his hands on the head of the scapegoat and confess all the iniquities of Israel, all their transgressions, all their sins, placed on the head of the goat and then the goat would be sent away into the wilderness. The goat would carry all those things into the wilderness.

This was to be a statue forever, they were to do no kind of work – both the native born and the outsider dwelling with YHWH/God’s chosen people. On this day, atonement was made for all, they would be [[Gate of Wisdom/Clean\|Clean]] before YHWH/God.

The scapegoat was for Azazel. Azazel in Hebrew can be translated as “the goat that goes away,” now shorted to scapegoat. Azazel is found no where else in the Biblical Canon we have today. Some scholars connect Azazel with Moc, the god of death. 

There is also a story of Azazel in Enoch. It tells that Azazel was the name of the leader of the angels who came down and sinned in Genesis 6:1-4. Azazel taught men all iniquity. YHWH/God told Raphael to bind Azazel and throw him into darkness and to write against him: ALL SIN. Thus the scapegoat takes all sin out of the Holy Place, into the wilderness, back to Azazel.

Whatever the story behind the Azazel-scapegoat, the goat would carry away the sins.

## The Present

If you haven’t already seen them, references to Jesus are all over the Day of Atonement, [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Yom HaKippurim\|Yom HaKippurim]].

There is repentance – they confessed their sins and symbolically placed them on the scapegoat which was turned out into the wilderness, removing the sins. Jesus suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood. God put his laws in their minds and wrote them on their hearts.

There is a sin offering – this symbolically covered the wages of sin – death. Instead of the people being put to death, the animal took their place. But then Jesus came. For the Son of Man did not come to be served but to give his life as a ransom for many. Since the children have flesh and blood, Jesus shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death. He died as a ransom to set free from sins committed under the first covenant.

There is cleansing – the blood symbolically cleansed the mercy seat, the tabernacle, and the other elements throughout the tabernacle – YHWH/God’s dwelling place. The Blood of Jesus cleanses our consciences from acts that lead to death. Jesus did not enter by blood of goats and calves, he entered by his own blood, obtaining eternal redemption.

There is a restoration of right relationship – all of the symbolism is a representation of YHWH/God’s love for them and once sin is removed from the temple, YHWH/God can dwell with them, and they can be in right relationship with him again. Jesus had to be made fully human in every way so he might become a merciful and faithful high priest, that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. Now, you are God’s temple and God’s Spirit dwells within you.

Once Jesus The Anointed One/Christ’s mission was accomplished on the cross, the Veil between the Set Apart Place/The Holy Place and the Most Set Apart Place/The Holy of Holies was torn in two, from top to bottom. We have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus, the Son of God, who has entered the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever.

So Jesus was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.

## The Future

Do no harm to the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.

A vast multitude that no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues – was standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.

They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. The One seated on the throne will shelter them. Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. He is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. He sacrificed for their sins, once for all, when he offered himself.

There is no temple in the city because God and the Lamb are its temple. Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.

Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns. Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready. Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear. Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb.

The third book contained the wicked deeds of the people. God said to the Adversary, these are yours, take them. The Adversary took them away, into a waste land.

## Christians

As a Christian, on this Day of Atonement – It was meant to be a day of rest (no work) and fasting.. Take time to repent, give thanks, and rejoice for all that YHWH/God and Jesus have done! Maybe take some time to read Hebrews Chapters 6-10 with some of these pictures in your mind – you may be surprised at what jumps out at you now. Take some time to read some of the scriptures referenced below. And be watchful!

> <sup>5 </sup> *Yeshua*  began to tell them, “Watch out that no one leads you astray! <sup>6 </sup> Many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and they will lead many astray. <sup>7 </sup> When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed, for this must happen but it is not yet the end. <sup>8 </sup> For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines. These things are only the beginning of birth pains.
> 
> <sup>33 </sup> “Keep on the lookout! Stay alert! For you do not know when the time is.
> 
> <sup>36 </sup> So watch in case, coming suddenly, he finds you asleep. <sup>37 </sup> What I say to you I say to all: ‘Stay alert!’”
> 
> Mark 13 (TLV)
