[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-28#v19\|Matt-28#v19]] Go and teach the peoples, immersing them in the character, reputation, authority, and purpose of Yah/God …

Jesus continues his instructions in verse 20. Teaching the nations to … here’s were we find out what is to be taught, what do you think it is?

To observe … for us today, this word doesn’t quite portray the meaning. We can observe something from afar, and when we think of observing something, we do not necessarily think of participating in that something while observing. However, this word, tēreō, is also translated as keep, reserve, watch, preserve, hold fast, to attend to carefully, take care of, to guard (Strong’s and Thayer’s).

To keep and guard what? All things whatsoever I \[Jesus\] have commanded. Couple of things to consider when determining what are the commandments Jesus commanded?

- The New Testament, not one page of it, existed at the time Jesus is saying this. Well, it could have existed in someone’s journal, but it wasn’t something available to the general public.
- The frame of reference of those hearing this was what we now refer to as the Old Testament, and what they hear Jesus say. He is talking to his followers, not a random crowd of people. These people would have heard many of Jesus’s teachings.
- Jesus says he did not speak on his own, but only what the Father who sent him had commanded him to speak. He said the Father’s commandment is life everlasting.
- In Acts 1 we see Jesus went and taught until the day he ascended, he told his disciples to wait for the Holy Spirit.
- In several passages in the Old Testament, we see Yah/God’s plan to put His Torah within people, upon their hearts, upon their minds through His Spirit.

We aren’t going to list out the actual commands here, if you know you should go, teach, and immerse people in the character, reputation, authority, and purpose of Yahweh/God, then this is something you should dive into the scriptures to discover.

Teaching the people to keep and guard what Jesus commanded, and Jesus will be with you always, even unto the end of the world.

We see a similar line to this in Jeremiah 7:23

> <sup>23 </sup> but I explicitly commanded them: ‘Obey My voice and I will be your God to you and you will be My people. Walk in all the ways that I command you that it may go well with you.
> 
> TLV

Now go and teach the peoples, immersing them in the character, reputation, authority, and purpose of Yah/God. Teaching them to keep and guard all that Jesus has commanded. Then Jesus will be with you always, even unto the end of the world.
