[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-05\|Matt-05]]

Although we’ve come to what has been labeled as the end of a Chapter, it is not the end of the Torah/Teaching Jesus is giving. We can’t set everything he’s said to this point aside just because we are moving into Chapter 6.

Let’s keep these things in mind:

- He is still speaking to his disciples. These are not random people, they have committed their lives to following Jesus. Some may believe he is the Messiah but most believe he is a Rabbi, some a Prophet.
- It is most likely the bulk of these disciples were of the Jewish faith. This doesn’t mean they are Jews, but it’s highly likely a lot were Jews. Some followed the written Torah/Law – what we find in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Numbers. Some additionally followed the oral traditions. And some were gentiles.
- Jesus is telling his disciples what living as his disciple would look like. What he expects of his followers.
- Jesus has specifically stated he did not come to abolish the Law of Moses/Torah or the Prophets.
- Jesus has specifically stated not one little mark would pass from the Law until heaven and earth pass away and until all is accomplished. Those listening would have distinguished between the Law of Moses which was written and the oral law. Jesus is not saying he didn’t come to abolish the oral law – only the Law of Moses and the Prophets.
- Jesus has specifically stated anyone who relaxes the least of the Law of Moses/Torah or teaches to, will be least in the Kingdom of Heaven/Where God Reigns.
- Jesus has specifically stated anyone who keeps and teaches the Law of Moses/Torah, will be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven/Where God Reigns.
- Jesus started off by confronting the teachings from 150 years before. A Jewish Teacher, Ben-Sirah Jesus had written a “blessed is” statement which was probably very familiar to many in the crowd. It fully immersed it’s self in the value of the world with status, admiration, etc. It was a culture where status was important. Jesus has totally dismantled these teachings with what we today call “The Beatitudes.”
- Jesus finished off “Chapter 5,” with bringing the true meaning back to the written commandment’s. He is restoring to a previous condition or refurbishing the Law and the Prophets. He has taken what they had seen as physical sins and turned them into heart sins. Simply not doing something doesn’t cut it with Jesus. He wants his disciples to change their heart so as not to get to the point of having to try not to do something.
