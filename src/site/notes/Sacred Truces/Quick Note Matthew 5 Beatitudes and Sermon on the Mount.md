Generally the Beatitudes are separated from the rest of Matthew 5, as well as Chapters 6 and 7 of Matthew containing the Sermon on the Mount. However, just as when we attend classes or lectures, everything builds upon each other.

As we continue on, keep in mind the torah/teaching Jesus has just given in verses 1-12. Use them to inform your understanding of what comes after them.

Those disciples who are humble in their life principles and their way of life; who are urging, imploring, exhorting, weeping; who rest in obedience to YHWH/God’s ways; who are hungry and thirsty and seeking after justice, fairness, and not sinning (being in right relationship with YHWH and others); who are merciful; who walk through life with a mind and thoughts which are clean and pure and see YHWH/God wherever they look; who as a peacemaker, reflect the image of YHWH/God striving to bring peace between man and YHWH/God and between men; who are cursed, persecuted, lied about, and all kinds of evil things said against them because of speaking YHWH/God’s truth, doing the right thing in YHWH/God’s eyes …

They are blessed/happy because they walk where God reigns/in the Kingdom of Heaven, are comforted, find kindness, see YHWH/God, are called a Son of God, know YHWH/God is pleased with them, and bring where God is/heaven to earth.
