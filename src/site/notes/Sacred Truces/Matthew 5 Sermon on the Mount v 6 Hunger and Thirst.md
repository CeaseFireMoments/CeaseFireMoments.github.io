[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-05\|Matt-05]]

Hunger and Thirst are shown together in several scriptures, I’ve listed many at the bottom of this post. But there is also a writing outside our current Cannon of scripture which Jesus and the disciples, and even Paul would have considered important and most likely studied as part of their up bringing. This saying is from the book of Jasher. Jasher was referred to in Joshua and 2 Samuel.

> And any man who had hunger and came to Abraham’s house, Abraham would give him bread that he might eat and drink and be satisfied, and any one that came naked to his house he would clothe with garments as he might choose, and give him silver and gold and make known to him the Lord who had created him in the earth; this did Abraham all his life.
> 
> Jasher 22

This is an interesting peek inside what happened in Abraham’s household. This would have certainly been something brought to mind in the Jewish disciples Jesus was giving this torah/teaching to. They my have thought to themselves, “Oh, I see, someone came to Abraham, they were filled, taken care of, and given what they needed.” Do you think your household resembles Abraham’s?

Hunger and thirsting are not pleasant feelings. Most of the world today has not actually experienced what true hunger and thirst feels like, even so, we know it isn’t something most would chose to happen to them. It isn’t a state typically sought after.

Righteousness – righteousness isn’t just being in right standing with YHWH/God, it is also being in right relationship with other’s as well. When one of YHWH/God’s people offended or transgressed someone, YHWH/God required not only a sacrifice to atone for the unrighteous act, but also a sacrifice to be given to the person who was transgressed against – in a double portion! If you stole a goat, you had to bring a goat to sacrifice as atonement, and two goats to give to the person you stole the goat from.

When we are not being active about this, we notice all is not well in YHWH/Gods world and we know YHWH/God is going to do something about it. This is not a place you want to be, so you will be actively seeking righteousness, keeping right relationship with both YHWH/God and others.

Righteous is about justice and fairness. When we seek to be righteous, we become the servants of righteousness (Romans 6). Job (29) put on righteousness and it clothed him as a robe and turbine. Later in Matthew, Jesus will say his disciples righteousness must exceed the religious leaders of that time.

The opposite of righteousness is sin.

Those hungry and thirsty and seeking after justice, fairness, and not sinning (being in right relationship with YHWH and others) are filled/satisfied. Are you filled and satisfied? Or do you find yourself asking for more and more? Unsatisfied with life? Maybe it’s time to figure out what being in right relationship with YHWH/God and other’s is as defined by YHWH/God – not man – and not you.

The Jewish flashbacks would include: [Psalms 107:9; Isaiah 44:3; Isaiah 55:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+107%3A9%3B+Isaiah+44%3A3%3B+Isaiah+55%3A1-2&version=TLV;OJB)
