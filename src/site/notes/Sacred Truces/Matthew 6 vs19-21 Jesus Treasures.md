[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-06#v19\|Matt-06#v19]]

This passage is pretty straight forward. It comes right after several statements from Jesus regarding rewards from our Father who is in and sees in secret. In verse 18 he said our Father who is seeing in secrete will reward manifestly or openly. Could those rewards be the treasures we can store up in Heaven/where God is?

Otzarot/Treasures are spoken of throughout the Scriptures as both the tangible as well as intangible.

- Proverbs 16, we are told to get wisdom and understanding rather than gold and silver.
- Ecclesiastes 2 we are told those who please God are given wisdom, knowledge, and joy. The sinner is given the business of gathering and collecting and ends up giving it to the one who pleases God.
- Isaiah 45 tells us Yah will go before and make crooked places straight. He will give treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places so we may know He is Yahweh.
- Proverbs 8, God gives substance to those who love him and he fills their treasuries.

Jesus says where these treasurers are, that is also where our hearts are. When our heart is in Heaven/where God is and focused on the Kingdom of Heaven/where God Reigns, the things which are pleasing to God will manifest outwardly. Those things, man can not destroy.

If we look back through Matthew 5 and 6 thus far, Jesus has pointed out several things we should be focused on storing up as treasures. He has also made it clear we shouldn’t be focused on the things of man. Matthew will bring up the them of treasurers several more times in his writings.

What treasures have you stored up?
