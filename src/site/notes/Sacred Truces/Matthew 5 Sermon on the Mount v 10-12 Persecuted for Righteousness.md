[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-05\|Matt-05]]

It is hard for us to envision persecution with being blessed/happy. We tend to see these as being on the opposite ends of the spectrum. Let’s break this one down.

What is righteousness? Earlier in Matthew 5, we were told those who hunger and thirst for righteousness are filled/satisfied. The Greek word implies justice and fairness. The Hebrew word is centered in being in right relationship both with YHWH/God and with others. By default, if we are not in right relationship with others, then we are not in right relationship with YHWH/God. It was a simple concept for the Jewish disciples listening to Jesus’s torah/teaching.

Being made free of sin, we became the servants of righteousness (Romans 6). Sin is the opposite of righteousness.

Now we can see a clearer picture of who these persecuted ones are. These are not people being persecuted for something they believe in. They are specifically, those who are persecuted for striving to be in right relationship with YHWH/God and others, seeking justice and fairness, they are blessed/happy because they are living where God reigns/the reign of the heavens. Sounds a lot like the peacemakers doesn’t it?

Jesus continues on about persecuted ones. He says, these persecuted ones, who are cursed, persecuted, lied about, and all kinds of evil things said against them, should shout for joy? Why?

Rewards in heaven? The Hebrew thought here in regards to rewards is similar to wages – your wages are great where God is/in heaven. The Greek thought is your rewards will be not necessarily more in number, but stronger, more intense.

These persecuted ones are just like the prophets who came before. They were willing to speak truth when the truth was unpopular. But they didn’t just speak THEIR truth, they were striving to be in right relationship with YHWH/God and bring others into right relationship with YHWH/God. Many of them were imprisoned or literally killed. Think of Daniel in the lions den. Think of Elijah fleeing and hiding. Think Moses leading the exodus from Egypt.

Persecuted for doing the right thing in YHWH/God’s eyes, not in man’s eyes. Think Jesus on the cross.

All blessed/happy because they knew YHWH/God was pleased with them because they were steadfast in walking where God reigns/in the reign of heaven.
