Mourning isn’t about sorrow because you’ve lost someone or something. The literal translation of the Hebrew is “Blessed are the weeping ones.”

Mourn is present tense, it isn’t always about being sad. This same exact word in Matthew 2 is translated as comforted. This same word is also translated in the text of Matthew as 8:5 (imploring), 31 (begging), 34 (begging); 14:36 (begging); Matthew 18:29 (begged), 32 (begged); 26:53 (call upon), as you can see, this word is most often translated to beg or begging in Matthew, not mourn.

It means to urge, implore, exhort, call to, appeal. Strong’s Concordance indicates “to refresh, cheer.” The Greek authors very rarely think of ‘mourn’ as something needing consoling.

Mourning isn’t always about what we experience, it’s also about what other’s experience and how we react to them and what they are going through.

Those who are urging, imploring, exhorting, weeping, are blessed because they are comforted in the moment.

Is that something you can accept? Can you believe when you are crying out you are blessed in the moment? Jesus said you are.

Some flashback moments for the Jewish disciples: [Psalm 37:11; Psalm 2:8; Numbers 12:3; Psalms 37:9; Psalms 37:34; Isaiah 30:15, Jeremiah 6:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2037%3A11%3B%20Psalm%202%3A8%3B%20Numbers%2012%3A3%3B%20Psalms%2037%3A9%3B%20Psalms%2037%3A34%3B%20Isaiah%2030%3A15%2C%20Jeremiah%206%3A16&version=TLV;OJB)
