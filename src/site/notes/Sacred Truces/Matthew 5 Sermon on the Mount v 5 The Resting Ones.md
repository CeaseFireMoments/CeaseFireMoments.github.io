[[_The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-05\|Matt-05]]

The meek, we have a vision of what meek means today, but it doesn’t necessarily paint the picture of what meek meant at the time Jesus was giving this torah/teaching.

This word carries with it the idea of someone who is gentle, humble, but it doesn’t mean someone who is timid, or someone others “walk all over”.

This same word is translated as righteous, the righteous inherit eternal life. The meek consider themselves as unimportant.

Jesus said he was meek. Matthew writes that the Messiah comes as meek.

The best way to overcome all our preconceived idea’s of meek would be to think of these people as those who rest in obedience to YHWH/God’s ways. It is someone who has a controlled spirit, a spirit controlled by YHWH/God’s Ruach/Breath (Holy Spirit).

Those who rest in obedience to YHWH/God’s ways are happy/blessed because they know they will inherit the earth.

If you know you are walking in YHWH/God’s ways, what is there to be concerned about? What is there to be upset about? It aligns with the saying, we read the end, we already know who wins. And those walking in YHWH/God’s ways will be greatest when YHWH/God finally reigns here on earth. So what of this world should be of greater concern than resting in YHWH/God’s ways?

The Jewish listeners would have had flashbacks to Flashback – [Psalm 37:11; Psalm 2:8; Numbers 12:3; Psalms 37:9; Psalms 37:34; Isaiah 30:15, Jeremiah 6:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+37%3A11%3B+Psalm+2%3A8%3B+Numbers+12%3A3%3B+Psalms+37%3A9%3B+Psalms+37%3A34%3B+Isaiah+30%3A15%2C+Jeremiah+6%3A16&version=TLV;OJB)
