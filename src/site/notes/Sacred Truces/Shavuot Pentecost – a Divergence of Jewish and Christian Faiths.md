We are in the season of the Yah/God’s appointed time of Shavuot. This particular Moedim of Yah goes by several names through out the Bible and in our modern times. It is connected to the Feast of First Fruits, is referenced in the English translations as Feast of Weeks, Festival of Oaths, and Feast of Harvest, and in the New Testament we can see it referred to as Pentecost.

Along with it’s multiple names, there are multiple dates calculated as to when to celebrate it based off of when Passover or Easter traditions are celebrated, and when the counting of the 50 days begins. However, it is the one time of the year when both the Jewish and the Christian faiths are celebrating very close to the same thing at the same time.

One looks at Mt. Sinai at the followers of YHWH, the native Israelites and adopted foreigners. They are gathered at the base of the mountain. They saw the thunder and lightening and heard the shofar/trumpet and saw the mountain covered with smoke. The Lord descended in fire and gave them The Testimonies, which we now call the commandments (Exodus 19 and 20 NIV). In those, Yah included appointed times to keep, the Feast of Weeks being one of them. His followers were to keep these times for all generations. The followers receive these testimonies written on tablets.

The other looks at mostly “Jewish” followers of Yeshua/Jesus gathered together to observe Shavuot, referred to by the Greek term Pentecost. They were gathered 50 days after the resurrection, 10 days after Jesus’s ascension. They heard a sound like the blowing of a violent wind filling the whole house and saw fire descended and rest like tongues on each of them. It was the giving of the promised Set-Apart Breath of Yah (Holy Spirit) sent to write God’s Testimonies/Commandments on their hearts and their minds. Just as foretold by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31,Acts 2, Hebrews 8, 10).

Here we have a convergence of beliefs. Both Jewish followers of YHWH and the Christian followers of Jesus standing in awe of the presence of Yahweh/God coming near and giving to them a sign of his covenant with them. This is where The Scriptures/OT meet The Second Writings/NT.

It’s also where the divergence happens. It’s here those in the Jewish faith reject Jesus as the Messiah, and the events which occurred in Acts. And it’s here those in the Christian faith reject God’s Torah, and the events which occurred in Exodus. Each have their patched together scriptural reasons for the fracture. Both ignoring so many straight forward scriptures and signs found in every scroll or book from Genesis to Revelation.

There is so much beauty to be seen if we are willing to open our eyes and see it. This is the wedding day. Its the day which has been prepared for and anticipated. Its the day when promises are made, vows are given, tokens are exchanged, and love is professed.

For the Israelites, it happened at the base of a Mountain. Whatever YHWH says, we will do. They were so in love with their rescuer, their redeemer. They made promises they would soon break. Vows they would toss aside. They would break Yah’s heart.

For modern day Jewish who reject Yeshua as the Messiah, they are still watching and waiting for his coming. But for the believers and followers in Jesus, it happened. They found themselves gathered together in a small room to remember the time of the Israelites back at the base of the Mountain. A time when they would be reflecting on all Yah had done for them. Some who were close observers might very well have been anticipating the promise Jesus had spoken about might be coming on this day. But I would guess many were surprised when all of a sudden they were having their very own base of the mountain experience. It had to be a very surreal moment for them. The past and the future converging together.

For modern day Christians, the beauty is missed as Pentecost (the Greek word for Shavout) has become a day to seek the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of the gifts. Current observance and traditions are far from anything found in Acts, and far overshadow the significance of exactly what took place that day.

Christian tradition has diverged from the meaning of this day as they seek for what presents will he give, missing those already given. It has to break Yah’s heart to some extent.

It was a wedding day. It was about a bride, seeking for her love, her rescuer, her redeemer. Wanting him to take her and cherish her. It was a day when a promise from the bridegroom was given. A token was bestowed. The bridegroom offered his vows speaking to her heart. It was a day he had been planning for and promised so many years earlier.

“I will put My Torah within them.  
Yes, I will write it on their heart.\[e\]  
I will be their God” (Jeremiah 31 TLV).

I will give you a new heart.  
I will put a new spirit within you.  
I will remove the stony heart from your flesh  
and give you a heart of flesh. \[a\]  
I will put My Ruach within you.  
Then I will cause you to walk in My laws,  
so you will keep My rulings and do them. (Ezekiel 26 TLV)

We shouldn’t be so quick to skip to the reception where we can open our gifts and miss the beauty of the wedding day. Appreciate the love which stands before you, rescuing you, redeeming you, loving you. Waiting for you to accept his promises and make your vows, express your love, and keep his ways.

He loves you … do you love him?

In that day,  
you will know that I am in My Father,  
you are in Me,  
and I am in you.  
He who has My commandments  
and keeps them  
is the one who loves Me.  
He who loves Me  
will be loved by My Father,  
and I will love him and reveal Myself to him.” (John 14 TLV)
