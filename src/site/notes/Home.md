## The [[Sacred Truces/_Sacred Truces\|_Sacred Truces]] Moments

During times of great important to those doing battle, a sacred truce would be called. The Greeks had a time called 'ekecheiria' which means "to hold hands." It allowed the warriors to have a safe time to celebrate, reflect, and participate in something of importance to them. One of the most notable ekecheira times is the Olympic Games. It was a time to be without fear of attack. 

The Ceasefire Moments are meant to be a time of learning about new concepts or ideas which may not be previously known. Its a time to lay down the weapons and the shields and take time to listen, not to agree, but to understand.

## The [[Yada Yada Pauses/_Yada Yada Pauses\|_Yada Yada Pauses]]

For deep dives into subjects, evoking the ancient tradition of seeking refuge in sacred spaces during conflicts. Taking time to consider all options. Reviewing inventory, information, and terrain before making the next move. 

In Hebrew - Yada means "to know." These Ceasefire Moments are for deep exploration of the subject at hand. Gathering information. Pausing to consider what is discovered. Carefully evaluating what needs toss and what is vital to keep on the journey ahead. It may mean dumping something you've been holding onto for a long time.

## The [[Olive Branch Reconciliations/_The Olive Branch Reconciliations\|_The Olive Branch Reconciliations]]

The ancient Mediterranean symbol of peace used in truces or diplomatic gestures was the olive branch which was extended for moments of reconciliation or seeking common ground. 

The biblical story of Noah's Ark, with the dove returning with an olive leaf, signifies the end of the flood, representing hope, renewal of life, and reconciliation.

In these Ceasefire Moments facts will be gathered and presented. How they are utilized and interpreted will be up to each individual. Verify and check out the resources as well as the information. Comparing references. But keep in mind, it's a time to seek common ground.

## [[Fireside Banquets/_Fireside Banquets\|_Fireside Banquets]]

When ancient Mesopotamian or Hittite kings negotiated peace treaties, representatives from opposing sides might gather for banquets. 

Among ancient nomadic tribes, including those related to the Hebrews, a fire might be lit during a sulha (reconciliation meeting) to share food or coffee as a sign of hospitality and peace. 

In these Ceasefire moments it's just like a potluck banquet, you never know what you are going to find. The adventure awaits!
